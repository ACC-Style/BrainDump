All component icons are now set to grey or red by default. However, converted and supportive components, along with the majority of new work, will be marked with either blue icons for compatible renderings or green for new arches components. This blue color is intended to be the default setting both arches and legacy supportive components. It's essential for the development team to review and ensure this default setting when releasing new work into the platform. In any instance where the blue green or grey is not the icon for the rending, the setting must be promptly corrected.\nFurther Icon Definition allow for even easier recognition in the back end will be. Page Layout components should be Starts, Vue/JavaScript driven components should be puzzle pieces. When looking at the display view list in the backend you only see the render name and its relative location that it is placed in the list. As the teams move forward in using more and more shared content and breaking down content into chunks the Display view gets rather unusable because you would see RichText written possibly 5 times on the page the same is true with accordions. In that view is it possible to interject at least the details of the source which can be altered with a nickname like intro-text, benefit grid.....The component dependency tree outlines the interrelationships between components in a Sitecore instance, specifically identifying those that are either children of a component or have dependent child components. Only necessary components should be configured in this instance to maintain simplicity and reduce confusion for editors. This approach also minimizes the risk of including non-supportive components by lessening the need for editors to manually add components. Ultimately, this method aids in preventing the appearance of non-supportive components within converted pages, ensuring a clean and efficient working environment.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"To improve editorial experiences certain steps and configurations should be updated within site core.","level":2,"id":"To_improve_editorial_experiences_certain_steps_and_configurations_should_be_updated_within_site_core._0"},{"heading":"Render Icon Colors in Sitecore","level":3,"id":"Render_Icon_Colors_in_Sitecore_0"},{"heading":"Enriching the Display View in the backend","level":3,"id":"Enriching_the_Display_View_in_the_backend_0"},{"heading":"Define the components  dependency tree","level":3,"id":"Define_the_components_dependency_tree_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/arches/conversion/components/quality-of-life-configurations-with-sitecore.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1726522599608,"modifiedTime":1749049295421,"sourceSize":2399,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Components/Quality of life configurations with Sitecore.md","exportPath":"work/acc/arches/conversion/components/quality-of-life-configurations-with-sitecore.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":43,"backlinks":["work/acc/arches/conversion/components/component-conversion-approach.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/editorial-training.html":{"title":"Editorial training","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Phase 1\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-1.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Phase 1</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Phase 2\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-2.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Phase 2</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Phase 3\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-3.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Phase 3</a><br>\n<a data-href=\"Phase 4\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-4.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Phase 4</a><br><a data-href=\"KT SESSIONS\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/kt-sessions.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">KT SESSIONS</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"experience editor","level":1,"id":"experience_editor_0"},{"heading":"conversation","level":1,"id":"conversation_0"}],"links":["work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-1.html","work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-2.html","work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-3.html","work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/phase-4.html","work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/kt-sessions.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/editorial-training.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1694445342505,"modifiedTime":1725477905194,"sourceSize":102,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Editorial training/Editorial training.md","exportPath":"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/editorial-training.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":45,"backlinks":["work/acc/arches/conversion/arches-conversion.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/kt-sessions.html":{"title":"KT SESSIONS","icon":"","description":"&nbsp;I want to outline a comprehensive Knowledge Transfer (KT) strategy that targets the required remediation steps. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition, allowing our team to manage the work systematically and avoid overwhelming our team resources and capabilities.&nbsp;Here's a step-by-step process to guide our KT activities:Sub-dividing the Conversion into Manageable Segments:&nbsp;We can accomplish tasks efficiently throughout the week by dividing the bulk conversion into themed work or manageable segments. For instance, focusing on a specific aspect like \"all the pages that have tabs\" will make the process more digestible and actionable.Weekly Kick-off Meeting for Conversion Blocks:&nbsp;At the start of the week, we will convene a meeting where a conversion block of pages is presented. This meeting will include a live demo showing how to make the necessary changes, providing an excellent opportunity for team members to understand the process firsthand.Standing 30-Minute Meetings throughout the Week:&nbsp;To ensure continuous support and clear communication, I suggest scheduling a standing 30-minute meeting every day. This stand-up meeting will be a forum to discuss any roadblocks or questions related to the assigned work. It will enable real-time problem-solving and maintain momentum in the project.Here’s a high-level schedule to illustrate the flow:Monday:&nbsp;Kick-off meeting with a conversion demo for the week's segment (e.g., pages with tabs).Tuesday to Friday:&nbsp;Daily 30-minute stand-up sessions to address questions and roadblocks.End of Week:&nbsp;Recap and assessment of the week's accomplishments, planning for the next segment.By adhering to this process, we aim to create a structured approach to knowledge transfer, facilitating the handling complex conversion tasks and empowering our team with the confidence and competence needed. Also, it's worth mentioning that our KT process is designed to be flexible and responsive to the team's evolving needs. As our collective experience and proficiency grow, we anticipate that the demand and duration of the daily stand-up meetings may not be needed or shortened. We'll continually assess the progress and adjust accordingly, ensuring our approach remains efficient and aligned with the team's capabilities. Continued feedback will be instrumental in this ongoing refinement, keeping us agile and focused on our shared goals.

Often grassroots in origin, these Editorially Created UI elements, composed of inline styles, in-page styles, and JavaScript, present considerable maintenance and update challenges.To manage this tech debt, our bulk conversion process aims to remediate or remove these elements. The goal is to align our UI with the Arches Enterprise Design System, which entails eliminating non-conforming in-page JavaScript and Styles.To facilitate this, we're conducting an audit of the Editorially Created UI components. This audit plays a crucial role in forming a plan that ensures website functionality while addressing unnecessary complexity.This process involves a meticulous examination and subsequent remediation of all editorially integrated links - a prerequisite before launching any audit. Our audit also thoroughly reviews content areas embedded with script and style blocks. Particular attention is given to the returned content scrape, which is systematically converted into a Unicode format that's safe for coding.As part of this procedure, we identify and replace certain patterns, such as \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\", with their equivalent symbols, and transform specific HTML entity codes into spaces and carriage returns, thereby improving block readability. This method allows the team to evaluate readable blocks effectively and discover any \"new\" patterns, which aids in documenting necessary remediation steps. This systematic approach prepares us for the eventual removal of style and script blocks, creating the necessary tickets or steps as required.Numbered Steps:\nBegin by running the remediation of all editorially included links that are set to \"Save\" before initiating the audit.\nPerform an <a data-href=\"#Audit Report\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html#Audit_Report_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Audit Report</a> of content areas that contain script and style blocks on the page.\n<br>Ensure the returned content scrap is converted into a code-safe Unicode because of the <a data-href=\"#Content Scrape Limitations\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html#Content_Scrape_Limitations_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Content Scrape Limitations</a>.\nIdentify and replace specific patterns, such as \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\", with their corresponding symbols.\nSubstitute certain HTML entity codes into space and transform others into carriage returns.\nEvaluate the now readable blocks after the aforementioned transformations.\n<br>Discover any new patterns that emerge from the evaluation, and document the appropriate <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Remediation\" data-href=\"Remediation\" href=\"work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/remediation.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">remediation steps</a>.\nFinally, create any necessary tickets or steps to prepare for the obliteration of style and script blocks.\nTo make the code more readable, it's crucial to replace certain Unicode characters with their typical representations. Specifically, we'll be dealing with the following conversions:\nThe Unicode for the carriage return, _000D_, should be replaced with a visual marker for carriage returns such as the symbol \"↵\".\nThe Unicode for the horizontal tab, _0009_, could be replaced with a few spaces for better visualization.\nThe Unicode for the space, _0020_, can be substituted with a visible space character.\nThe line feed character, represented by the Unicode _000A_, can be swapped with a new line symbol like \"␤\" to depict line breaks better.\nThe tab character, also represented by _0009_, should be replaced with a few spaces for clarity.\nFinally, the Unicode for less than and greater than symbols, &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;, can be converted to their actual \"&lt;\" and \"&gt;\" symbols.\nBy transforming these Unicode characters into their corresponding visual representations, we significantly enhance the comprehensibility of the document, thus facilitating easier identification of different elements and their spacing.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Processing Notes.","level":2,"id":"Processing_Notes._0"},{"heading":"Audit Report","level":2,"id":"Audit_Report_0"},{"heading":"Content Scrape Limitations","level":2,"id":"Content_Scrape_Limitations_0"}],"links":["work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html#Audit_Report_0","work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html#Content_Scrape_Limitations_0","work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/remediation.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1689601151487,"modifiedTime":1689961622370,"sourceSize":4162,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Audit of Editorial UI.md","exportPath":"work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":53,"backlinks":["work/acc/arches/conversion/process/bulk-conversion-outline-old.html","work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel-tables.html","work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/editorial-bulk-change-notice-excel.html":{"title":"Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel","icon":"","description":"The process of bulk conversion is a nuanced operation that significantly depends on the scope of the pages being converted.

Over the past year, I have been putting work together to support a massive shift in how we do frontend and, in the long run, how we develop, support, and release our college software solutions.&nbsp;The most significant issue I continually see in IT is decentralized coding efforts. Decentralization leads to repetitive solutions, inconsistent behaviors, extended regression testing, bloated packages, complicated deployments, and potential code errors as we try to make security patches or upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;Focusing on improving how we execute frontend for the college and not just for a project, I have tackled four pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nUnification of design but building for flexibility\nShifting to the CFD (component first development )\nCreating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored\nCentralizing everything for everyone\nThe unification of design was the first place I started. \"Arches\" is the current solution that enforces a Design Opps procedure to streamline requests and deliver a college-wide design system. This design system has two tenants. First, it can replicate its styles influenced by the brand and frameworks from its product space. It now covers QII, ACC, Cardiosmart, and Mobile and can be further scaled. Second is its utility framework that ensures a highly flexible practice to allow countless UI permutations without CSS mutations. Utility styling is also known as \"scopeless\" styling because you can build out many UI patterns without ever altering the original styles.&nbsp; &nbsp;<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link is-unresolved\" href=\"https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/\" target=\"_self\">https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/</a>Shifting to CFD (component first development) embraces an architecture for our frontend products and alters how we develop. CFD, as a pattern, has been around since 2012 with bootstrap. In its infancy, CFD could only capture minor token UI. Still, with the introduction of javascript models like Web Components, React, Vue CFD can now capture business logic, complicated interface interactions, and data mutations. Vue has been my primary focus as it builds on the collective knowledge of the department. Vue has the capabilities to make obsolete Jquery UI, Pager, Knockout, Angular, JqueryMobile, and many other libraries that are currently in use. IT streamlining to a single dependency allows for universal software patching for frontend security issues.&nbsp;Currently, we are creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored. As we shift to CFD, we can use Storybook which allows for documentation around a living singular component with artificial data. This type of documentation gives a single point of Design, Development, and QA. The effort on a single element can be attached to countless projects through version control. Centralized development and QA can give us a feasible path to automated unit testing and regression testing. As new projects come online, utilizing the global-version-controlled components would benefit from standards, consistency, and quality control.

When talking about onboarding, we want to consider 4 user states: ​\nLOGGED OUT\nNOT A MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE\nA MEMBER WHO DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SECTION\nA USER WITH FULL ACCESS.​\n​These personalization hooks give us the flexibility to craft the experience, allowing for better instructions and selling tactics.Only users of a specific state are shown the&nbsp;next steps in their personalized journey. ​ This allows us to craft the upsell and instructions to Membership for example or the Member Section when the time is appropriate.Now that the onboarding process has become simplified in messaging and action, we can discuss how our users are often part of more than one section. To reduce mental friction when moving from one section to another, we want to strongly enforce consistency.​ This consistency can been seen in the design pattern, the layouts and more importantly the labels and page structures. ​\nThis will allow our multifaceted members to experience an organized environment so they can focus on the content rather than where it was labeled or placed. An added benefit is that when new features are rolled out, they are easier to discover.​Personalization will not be added to just the main page. The content zones of sections will also showcase content at different levels keyed to the user's access. This can showcase the quality of materials and enforce a desire to gain full access to this quality content.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#project"],"headers":[],"links":["work/acc/projects/member-sections.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/acc-conversion-to-arches/refactors/member-sections-presentation-script.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749049168465,"modifiedTime":1749051839137,"sourceSize":3039,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Conversion to Arches/Refactors/Member Sections Presentation Script.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/acc-conversion-to-arches/refactors/member-sections-presentation-script.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":162,"backlinks":["work/acc/projects/member-sections.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/acc-conversion-to-arches/acc.org-conversion.html":{"title":"ACC.org Conversion","icon":"","description":"Build ACC using Arhces","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#project"],"headers":[],"links":["work/acc/projects/acc-conversion-to-arches/children-rendering/children-rendering-rough-notes.html","work/acc/projects/tickets/hero-banners-&-micro-banner.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/acc-conversion-to-arches/acc.org-conversion.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1725474537991,"modifiedTime":1725477920486,"sourceSize":1462,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Conversion to Arches/ACC.org Conversion.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/acc-conversion-to-arches/acc.org-conversion.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":163,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/★-aha-professional-american-heart-membership-site.html":{"title":"★ AHA Professional - American Heart Membership Site","icon":"","description":"Readability:\nScore: 34 – Good; Minor Tweaks Only\nBreakdown:Estimated Visitors:\nApproximately 400,000–500,000 monthly (based on SimilarWeb and verified public sources)Estimated Membership Numbers:\nApproximately 35 million volunteers and supportersExplanation:\nProfessional Heart Daily (PHD) operates as a distinct subdomain focusing on professional education, guidelines, and resources.

It offers a mix of technical and accessible vocabulary, and while sentence length and density are moderate, content is largely digestible. The tone is professional, and medical jargon is often defined, especially in patient-facing sections. The layout supports decent scannability, though CTA buttons could be clearer, more action-oriented, but using some great focused text for CTA.Estimated Visitors: Approximately 3 million monthly visitors.\nEstimated Membership Numbers: Over 33 million volunteers and supporters.Explanation: The main site (heart.org) and the journal site (ahajournals.org) operate on separate domains with distinct branding and navigation.

The content serves different audiences with minimal overlap.\nExplanation: The main site offers the majority of its content—including patient education, healthy living resources, donation opportunities, and volunteer programs—freely available to the public. While professional tools and journal access may require membership or payment, these are not part of the main site’s public-facing content. Most of the content is on Proffesional.heart.org so much so the login doesn't show up until the user is on that subdomain.\nStrong Brand holds the Subs together but the main nav is \"Teased\" on the main site but the entire nav swaps out when your in that experience.\nExplanation: The site includes information on getting involved through volunteering, donations, and becoming a heart health advocate. However, there’s less emphasis on structured onboarding for new members or supporters—details are available but not spotlighted or guided with a welcoming narrative. It’s informative but not highly personalized or welcoming. There is a complete separate website for the professional where they ask people to become part of the org. Explanation: The AHA addresses both the general public and professionals, offering resources ranging from patient education to scientific research, reflecting a broad inclusivity.​ The content is designed to be accessible and relevant to a broad audience, including the general public, patients, and caregivers, without requiring specialized medical knowledge.\nExplanation: The tone across AHA's platforms is professional yet accessible, aiming to engage a wide audience without compromising on scientific integrity.Radar Chart Scores: Member Networking Opportunities: ★★☆☆☆ Donations &amp; Philanthropy: ★★★★★ Events: ★★☆☆☆ Scientific Publications / Latest Science: ★☆☆☆☆ Practice Support Resources: ★★★☆☆ Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: ★★★★★ Education: ★★☆☆☆ Advocacy: ★☆☆☆☆\nRationale: Membership &amp; Networking Opportunities: Minimal presence on heart.org. Professional networking largely lives off-site or in conference contexts. Donations &amp; Philanthropy: Highly visible and emphasized, with multiple calls to donate, fundraise, or give in honor of someone. Events: Community events like Heart Walks and Go Red for Women are promoted, but less focus on large-scale scientific events or purchasable events. Scientific Publications / Latest Science: Virtually absent from the main site; most science communication is generalized for lay audiences. <br>\nPractice Support Resources: Some tools for CPR, emergency response, and guidelines for laypersons exist, but not robust clinical tools unless you know where you are going and then you can find an equivalent to NCDR with <a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines\" data-href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines\" href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Get with the Guideline Registry</a>. Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: Heart.org excels in this category, offering rich educational content, risk assessments, and interactive tools. Education: Strong emphasis on public education, and awareness campaigns But limited training courses (like CPR), and no purchasable continuing education or modules for medical professionals. All reference to continuing learning is buried on the main site and is mostly hosted on its E-learning Sub Domain. elearn.heart.org Advocacy: It is on the site but it is very hard to find but does exist. Art Direction strong visual branding with single color usage the red and white. High usage of photos because of their public facing mission that humanizes the site. Extra Care on all pages to reserve \"button\" for limited usage because of the single color branding. Red in the UI is dropped in tone in the UI so it has proper contrast. Structure of the content is spread across multiple sites where the main site is much more Advocacy, Public Education with pass offs to the sister sites. Clear focus of audience and cleaning away distractions. Cleanliness is a focus of all pages. Dates only show up when referencing things that are \"latest\" Listed items are almost always reserved to less then 5 items.\nSub Domain-ing with altering Context and Main Nav CPR.heart.org\nLearn.heart.org\nProfessional.heart.org\n.... The subduing is markable, interesting and allows for greater division of audience and improves focus, but it does impede discoverability, and only because this research has forced deep diving into their content. Did I discover some of the nuanced areas. It is very easy as an audience member or user to be confused about why the main is altering because the branding is so locked up the edges between the main site and CPR, for example, are minimal and a user might just be shocked that they may NAV item that they were utilizing disappears.

Minimal links between the two—such as the AMA site directing users to the JAMA Network for publications—the user experience is disjointed. Users must navigate between different interfaces, and there is no unified account system or integrated search functionality across both platforms. This separation indicates a loosely connected integration of experience.​\nNo logo Sharing\nNo Design Sharing\nBarely Spells out JAMA\nScience Only\nRationale: The content between the AMA main site and the JAMA Network is largely distinct.

It is possible that behind membership walls this become more prominent or easier to find.\nScientific Publications / Latest Science: With access to the JAMA Network and other publications, the AMA offers substantial scientific resources, but on the main site it is reserved to news elements about public health, practice, advocacy and the practice reserving the latest science to live only on Jama.\nPractice Support Resources: Resources are available articles are written to support medical practice management and an entire segment craft to multiple facets of practice support.\nPatient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: The site primarily targets medical professionals, with limited content directly aimed at patients. this type of content is practically no where on the site.\nEducation: Educational resources, including CME opportunities and the AMA Ed Hub, are robust and well-integrated into the site.\nAMA clearly has a design system library in place. The collection of UI pattern feels pretty high so there is a certain about of consistency degradation not because they aren't following the rules but because they have too many to really show a visual pattern. They have an extensive collection of patterns makes the site feel a little clumsy and overwhelming high usage of images that hold content and text utilizing font treatments that are not matching.They collapse away their main NAV into a burger menu even on desktop when you are not on the homepage this is an interesting choice. I find it slightly frustrating because I am trying to move around the site as much. Maybe it isn't as much of an issue when users are being directed by Google and cross discovery isn't as important. It does reduce the overall visual noise which is pretty high on their site.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"American Medical Association (<a rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.ama-assn.org/</a>)","level":2,"id":"American_Medical_Association_([https//www.ama-assn.org/](https//www.ama-assn.org/))_0"},{"heading":"Main Site vs. Journal Site","level":3,"id":"Main_Site_vs._Journal_Site_0"},{"heading":"Integration of Experience (X-Axis)","level":4,"id":"Integration_of_Experience_(X-Axis)_0"},{"heading":"Content Overlap (Y-Axis)","level":4,"id":"Content_Overlap_(Y-Axis)_0"},{"heading":"Membership Experience","level":4,"id":"Membership_Experience_0"},{"heading":"Brand Personality","level":4,"id":"Brand_Personality_0"},{"heading":"Strategic Emphasis on Organizational Initiatives","level":3,"id":"Strategic_Emphasis_on_Organizational_Initiatives_0"},{"heading":"Radial Chart","level":4,"id":"Radial_Chart_0"},{"heading":"Additional Notes","level":4,"id":"Additional_Notes_0"},{"heading":"Art Direction","level":5,"id":"Art_Direction_0"},{"heading":"UX Warning","level":5,"id":"UX_Warning_0"}],"links":["work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/ama-american-medical-association.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753113716564,"modifiedTime":1753973346521,"sourceSize":7703,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/AMA -- American Medical Association.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/ama-american-medical-association.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":171,"backlinks":["work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html","work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/data/ad-usage.html","work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/data/matrix-chart-data.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/esc-european-society-of-cardiology.html":{"title":"ESC -- European Society of Cardiology","icon":"","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Competitive Analysis\" data-href=\"Competitive Analysis\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">&lt;-- back to competitive analysis</a>Readability:\nScore: 35 – Good; Minor Tweaks OnlyBreakdown:Summary:\nESC’s website is structured cleanly for professional and academic users. The reading level suits clinicians and researchers, with technical vocabulary prevalent throughout. Some jargon appears without consistent definition, especially in professional news articles. Sentence structures are a bit formal and often lean passive, though the layout and design promote good scan-ability. CTAs could be stronger to drive user action more clearly.Estimated Visitors: Approximately 1.2 million monthly visitors, according to Similarweb.​\nEstimated Membership Numbers: Over 105,000 healthcare professionals worldwide.Integration of Experience: Explanation: Since the journal content is fully integrated within the main escardio.org domain with consistent branding and top-level navigation access, the user experience is relatively unified. Although some journal content may still open in external viewer windows, the structural integration supports a more cohesive experience.Content Overlap:\nExplanation: The journals and the main site both target healthcare professionals, and while their formats differ (news/guidelines vs. academic papers), their thematic overlap is clear. Users encounter both journal links and practice guidance fluidly in the same experience, without unnecessary duplication.Content Locking:\nExplanation: Access to certain resources, such as full guidelines and educational materials, requires membership or payment, indicating partial content locking.​Onboarding:\nExplanation: The ESC provides clear pathways for professionals to join, with detailed information on membership benefits, suggesting a well-structured onboarding process.​Audience Focus:\nExplanation: The ESC primarily targets healthcare professionals, with limited resources for the general public, indicating a somewhat inclusive audience focus.​Tone &amp; Expression:\nExplanation: The tone across ESC's platforms is professional yet accessible, aiming to engage healthcare professionals without compromising on scientific integrity.​Radar Chart Scores:\nMembership &amp; Networking Opportunities: ★★★★☆ Donations &amp; Philanthropy: ☆☆☆☆☆ Events: ★★★★★ Scientific Publications / Latest Science: ★★★★★ Practice Support Resources: ☆☆☆☆☆ Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: ☆☆☆☆☆ Education: ★★★★☆ Advocacy: ★☆☆☆☆ Rationale:\nMember Networking Opportunities: The ESC offers networking through its associations, working groups, and events, providing ample opportunities for professional connections.​\nDonations &amp; Philanthropy: While the ESC is a nonprofit organization, there is limited reference public fundraising or philanthropic campaigns on the main site.​ I can't find any significant mention on if you can donate and the current google reference to a donation page 404's\nEvents: The ESC hosts numerous events, including the prominent ESC Congress, catering to healthcare professionals globally, but most of its Event content is co-mingled and content-centric with the news on ESC 365.​\nScientific Publications / Latest Science: With a suite of high-impact journals and regular updates, the ESC continually published a well connected campaign around cardiovascular research.​\nPractice Support Resources: Provides guidelines and tools for healthcare, but practically missing any materials around practice support I would expect that is partially because the audience is the EU and that level of information would be shaped by the country level and would be to complex to outline at this organizations level.\nPatient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: The primary focus remains on healthcare professionals, and barely any educational materials for patients, and I am not sure if I found any for a patient that was looking for any basic information.\nEducation: Delivers a range of educational programs and certifications, such as online courses and webinars, for healthcare professionals, but mostly pushing off to it E-learn site to house the marketing.. Advocacy: You can find note of advocacy deep with in the sections of the site but they are clearly connected with the iniatives and you would need to know they are there and more hidden then present on the site. A remarkably polished site. There is use of both graphics and photos which does sometimes challenge the focus of the art direction, but UI standards across the site in such an expensive manner is well held together. Clearly there is a design system utilized, and this site being relatively young is not showing any markers of age or deviating from the strategic content alignment. The only negative I can really put against the ESC is even at their reduced focus of scope, comparative to the other associations in our review the produce a lot and the site is very expansive. They are pushing the edges of what can be easily discoverable, and I am sure there is more content that a user would have to dig for. I am curious how they deal with those constructs and limitations. I do want to note their clinical documents page at first usage is not the greatest answer for there overwhelming content problem because more items are hidden than easily discoverable.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"European Society of Cardiology ( [https://www.escardio.org | escardio.org] )","level":2,"id":"European_Society_of_Cardiology_(_[https//www.escardio.org_|_escardio.org]_)_0"},{"heading":"Membership Experience","level":4,"id":"Membership_Experience_0"},{"heading":"Brand Personality","level":4,"id":"Brand_Personality_0"},{"heading":"Strategic Emphasis on Organizational Initiatives","level":3,"id":"Strategic_Emphasis_on_Organizational_Initiatives_0"},{"heading":"Additional notes","level":4,"id":"Additional_notes_0"},{"heading":"Art direction","level":5,"id":"Art_direction_0"},{"heading":"UX warning - density of content","level":5,"id":"UX_warning_-_density_of_content_0"},{"heading":"Example of hiding too much content","level":6,"id":"Example_of_hiding_too_much_content_0"}],"links":["work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/esc-european-society-of-cardiology.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749049168468,"modifiedTime":1749051840027,"sourceSize":6965,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/ESC -- European Society of Cardiology.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/esc-european-society-of-cardiology.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":172,"backlinks":["work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html","work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/data/ad-usage.html","work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/data/matrix-chart-data.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/facs-american-college-of-surgeons.html":{"title":"fACS -- American College of Surgeons","icon":"","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Competitive Analysis\" data-href=\"Competitive Analysis\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">&lt;-- back to competitive analysis</a>Readability:\nScore: 30 – Good; Minor Tweaks OnlyBreakdown:Estimated Visitors:\n~400,000–500,000 monthly (based on SimilarWeb and verified public sources)Estimated Membership Numbers:\n~90,000 members (based on ACS official reports)Explanation:\nThe Journal of the American College of Surgeons operates on a completely different platform (Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins / Wolters Kluwer) with its own domain and infrastructure.\nNo shared navigation menus between the main ACS site and the journal\nNo visual branding alignment or consistent cross-site navigation.\nFull content is managed separately under LWW's portal, not ACS’s membership login.\nContent focus is distinct — original research and scientific publications without duplication of ACS's advocacy, education, or professional development content. Thus, the two sites are fully disconnected with very low/no content overlap.Explanation:\nBasic public content is freely available — news, advocacy, and patient-facing materials. However, guidelines, clinical resources, and career development tools are behind a login wall. Membership onboarding is solid: clear pathways to join, member benefits well articulated, and structured new member orientation available.Explanation:\nThe primary audience remains surgical professionals, creating a somewhat exclusive environment. Patient resources exist but are secondary. Tone throughout the site is highly professional and formal — focused on credibility and rigor rather than emotional appeal or expressiveness.Note: even though the content leans to longer their is a clear focus on priority of content so pages rarely get overly robust or dense.

Networking and philanthropy are supported but not as dominant as their educational mission. Patient-facing content is present but takes a back seat to professional development.One of the more interesting websites in relation to our direction is mostly around their shifting main NAV and hero image graphics. The impactful sweeping cut image doesn't always work perfectly because of content not constraining to the rules as much as they need to, but it does make a more visually impactful design. The rest of the site has a tight control on color, mostly a black to navy blue with small accents of red.A surprising amount of images is across the site and though most likely stock it seems to be a professional grade. All images have the similar color, toning and keying, which allows all images to feel like they're from the same set. There is nothing that breaks from high contrast, a low contrast or saturated low saturation.The site has an issue approach on main navigation with a three tiered separation of audience right off the bat from the homepage. This causes the main NAV to \"personalize\". This is a great way for them to separate their concerns and focus their audiences. I'm curious what strategic documents they must have to make sure that content is placed in the right context and it is possible that they are just more accurate about dividing their audience use case because they only shift between (researcher, surgeon, patient), and do not have the nuanced audience platform that ACC has which is almost every medical profession level associated with cardiology.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"American College of Surgeons (<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://www.facs.org\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" class=\"external-link\" href=\"https://www.facs.org\" target=\"_blank\">facs.org</a>)","level":2,"id":"American_College_of_Surgeons_([facs.org](https//www.facs.org))_0"},{"heading":"Matrix Charts","level":3,"id":"Matrix_Charts_0"},{"heading":"Main Site vs Journal Site Comparison (ACS)","level":2,"id":"Main_Site_vs_Journal_Site_Comparison_(ACS)_0"},{"heading":"Membership Experience","level":4,"id":"Membership_Experience_0"},{"heading":"Brand Personality","level":4,"id":"Brand_Personality_0"},{"heading":"Strategic Emphasis (Radar Chart)","level":4,"id":"Strategic_Emphasis_(Radar_Chart)_0"},{"heading":"Additional Notes","level":4,"id":"Additional_Notes_0"},{"heading":"Art Direction","level":5,"id":"Art_Direction_0"},{"heading":"Image Usage","level":5,"id":"Image_Usage_0"},{"heading":"UX Notes","level":6,"id":"UX_Notes_0"}],"links":["work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/facs-american-college-of-surgeons.html","pathToRoot":"../../../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1749049168469,"modifiedTime":1749051840150,"sourceSize":5896,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/fACS -- American College of Surgeons.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/facs-american-college-of-surgeons.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":173,"backlinks":["work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/competitive-analysis.html","work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/data/ad-usage.html","work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/data/matrix-chart-data.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/hfsa-heart-failure-society-of-america.html":{"title":"HFSA -- Heart Failure Society of America","icon":"","description":"Readability:\nScore: 24 – Average; Could Benefit from Minor Edits\nBreakdown:\nReading Level: 3 – 10th–12th Grade Sentence Length: 3 – 20–25 words avg.

Deeper educational materials, full conference recordings, and certain guidelines are gated for members. There's a relatively friendly and proactive onboarding pathway — clear \"Join Now\" CTAs, member value propositions, and defined next steps post-registration.The primary audience is still electrophysiologists and cardiac device professionals, making the experience somewhat insider-focused.

Often sounds like a compliance document or corporate report. Still technical but spells out terms. Reads like it’s trying to avoid liability more than inform or inspire. -2: Dry and Technical\nInformation is accurate but lacking human warmth. Text reads like textbooks or white papers—clarity exists, but personality is absent. Occasional headings help, but voice is purely mechanical. -1: Flat with Occasional Warmth\nGenerally neutral and professional, with rare moments of friendliness. Might use plain language or some light subheads, but lacks a consistent effort to be human or engaging. 0: Approachable Professional\nBalanced and clear. Uses active voice and plain language without dumbing it down. Minimally expressive but readable and human.

Feels less like a document and more like a person. +2: Friendly and Professional\nConversational, confident, and approachable. Clear identity in voice without losing credibility or clarity. +3: Warm and Engaging\nActively uses tone to build rapport. Strong emphasis on accessibility, encouragement, and human touch. May include inclusive phrasing and emotional cues. +4: Fully Expressive\nBold, vibrant tone with emotional resonance. Uses storytelling, rhetorical flair, and confident voice to create deep engagement and connection.

Responses to Word Doc","icon":"","description":"Assessment Categories:&nbsp;Yes all but one have separate sites and the effort it must take to hold ECSD together seems like an un wise effort. Most sites have some overlap but mostly the content is treated separately where most sites focus on the Association, Policy, and News where the Journal focus on the science. The division of science content varies where ACC is the worst offender of repeating and pointing to the journal and Neural is the Cleanest break.AMA has an blended approach with a heavy focus on videography news that seems to blur the line but is still more editoral vs science in the end and not cloning like the acc. This is also a blended approach but half fall into a singular link that drives them to the site and no way back from the journal. Others have publication pages that do more or less effort on \"teasing\" the publication only to teasing the current content in the publication at the same time. Only the ACC has this content interspersed throughout the site and most are a focus section or a page on the site only.All of the associations present events on either their home page or on a dedicated area off of the main nav. Things to note:\nESC takes over their homepage during their big conference\nHSR does third party events to make their calendar seem more full.\nOn how they are supported it is honestly hard to tell some have teasers on the site and then drive to a shopping registration portal.\nMost of the organization layout the membership onboarding pretty well on their site up front and center. Only AHA has a differnt sub-site for membership because of their business model. All of the sites are much more upfront to the Member login vs just a site login and there are hints of more content beyond but it is honestly hard to tell. Depends on the org some don't have any like ESC, and HRS, and then the king of it is AHA.Impossible to tell if there is any it is beyond the wall and the don't really market it.Most don't really it is pretty limited and is reserved to be on the Journal Sites. AMA is the greatest exception to this rule because they have a distinct focus and even a site for Video Editorial and Science Review that is outside of the focus of JAMA.Feeds of articles on all sites are simpler then what ACC presents we are much more verbose on meta data and just content around article teasers on the stie.Most of the Walling is either Transactional which is more aggressive to almost all of the orgs where purchasing is only possible for members or whole sections to review the materials for sale are beyond a pay wall. Or the walling was Membership value focused AMA holds most of the video articles beyond a membership wall. All other walling is focused primarily in the journal sites and no Main site element had a Teaser content approach it was either upfront this was a member area or there was a login directly from an article teaser. Teased on the main page most go to a dedicated area, platform for the education some only do Member only purchases and bigger Associations like ESC do pricing. All of them have sister sites Ama the most disjointed ESC and AHA most harmonious in the brand.AHA leads the pack on this one but most don't really put a lot of focus on patients except FACS. FACS has a wing of its site for patients.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"1.

Trend: A lasting direction of change that evolves with culture, technology, and need. &nbsp; Fads entertain. Trends endure. Great UX understands the difference. Design Fads Over the Years: Each changed the look, but few changed the function. &nbsp; Paper: Humanity’s Most Trusted Medium For decades, the web has tried to emulate paper. Why? Because it works. Structure. Focus. Flexibility. Emotional resonance. From ancient scrolls to PDFs, paper design principles still anchor our best digital experiences. &nbsp; Paper succeeds because it balances multiple strengths: &nbsp; ✉️ Clarity of Message – Letters, memos 📰 Discovery of the New – Newspapers, classifieds 🖼️ Impactful Visuals – Magazines, posters 📚 Valuable Information – Books, guides ✏️ Customization – Highlights, sticky notes, annotations &nbsp; Most sites optimize for just one. Paper did all five. So can we as an organization.&nbsp; As attention fragments, clarity becomes currency. UX has shifted toward hyper-specialization Pages are built to convert, not to fill the page. Copy is short. Navigation is shallow. Intent is precise. Clarity isn’t about simplicity—it’s about deliberate structure that speaks to one goal at a time. &nbsp; People no longer skim pages. They skim the entire internet. Internal discovery is losing ground to: &nbsp; Google Social feeds AI summaries &nbsp; &nbsp;\nMost users rarely land on a homepage—they enter sideways. &nbsp;\nUX Shift: Design for entry anywhere Create value in context, not just structure Focus on external discoverability &nbsp; We’re drowning in images—but starved for meaning. Social platforms flood us with visuals Brands succeed not by quantity, but creative direction Design ≠ decoration\nVisuals must: &nbsp; Tell stories Guide attention Build trust Lack of Creative Direction = Unprofessional\n&nbsp;\nThe web must reclaim art direction as a strategic asset. &nbsp; People still read 300-page books—and it’s not by accident. They commit when content has: Trustworthy value A strong point of view A clear, structured narrative Emotional investment through storytelling &nbsp; UX Implication: &nbsp; If your experience isn’t worth staying for, users won’t. Earn attention with ease, trust, and purpose. The Web Is Finally Catching Up to Paper Paper was always personal: highlighted, folded, annotated. The web now offers: 🌓 Light/Dark Modes 🪄 TL;DR Summaries 🔠 Font scaling, reader modes 🧠 Adaptive dashboards &amp; feeds &nbsp;\nCustomization is no longer a luxury. It’s expected. UX must adapt to the user—not force the user to adapt to the site. Where We’re Headed Design for meaning, not just motion Build systems over stunts Embrace structure that respects attention Align design with discovery models beyond your domain Create durable experiences—as useful in 3 years as they are today Trends build trust. Fads just chase clicks. Not a Slide &nbsp;Takeaways for leaders &nbsp; ✅ Learn from paper—not just pixels ✅ Don’t confuse trendiness with durability ✅ Design for clarity, discovery, visual impact, and value ✅ Let users shape the experience through customization ✅ If your content is worth 300 pages—treat it that wayOptimization ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"“Navigated by Trends, Not Chasing Fads”","level":1,"id":"“Navigated_by_Trends,_Not_Chasing_Fads”_0"},{"heading":"A Future-Focused Look at UX Design","level":3,"id":"A_Future-Focused_Look_at_UX_Design_0"},{"heading":"Slide 1:","level":1,"id":"Slide_1_0"},{"heading":"Navigated by Trends, Not Chasing Fads","level":1,"id":"Navigated_by_Trends,_Not_Chasing_Fads_0"},{"heading":"Slide 2: Fads vs. Trends","level":2,"id":"Slide_2_Fads_vs._Trends_0"},{"heading":"Slide 3: The Cosmetic Nature of Fads","level":2,"id":"Slide_3_The_Cosmetic_Nature_of_Fads_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_0"},{"heading":"Slide 4: The Internet’s Longest Trend","level":2,"id":"Slide_4_The_Internet’s_Longest_Trend_0"},{"heading":"Slide 5: Why Paper is So Hard to Get Right Online","level":2,"id":"Slide_5_Why_Paper_is_So_Hard_to_Get_Right_Online_0"},{"heading":"Slide 6: Clarity of Message","level":2,"id":"Slide_6_Clarity_of_Message_0"},{"heading":"Slide 7: Discovery of the New","level":2,"id":"Slide_7_Discovery_of_the_New_0"},{"heading":"Slide 8: Impactful Visuals","level":2,"id":"Slide_8_Impactful_Visuals_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_1"},{"heading":"Slide 9: Valuable Information","level":2,"id":"Slide_9_Valuable_Information_0"},{"heading":"Slide 10: Customization","level":2,"id":"Slide_10_Customization_0"},{"heading":"Slide 11: The Future of UX","level":2,"id":"Slide_11_The_Future_of_UX_0"},{"heading":"","level":2,"id":"_2"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/future-of-ux-presentation.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753113716590,"modifiedTime":1753973344531,"sourceSize":4785,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Future of UX Presentation.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/future-of-ux-presentation.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":216,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html":{"title":"Strategic Glossary of Page Concepts in ACC.org","icon":"","description":"Page Concept Types\n<a data-href=\"#① Home Page\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#①_Home_Page_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">① Home Page</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"#② Concept Anchors\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#②_Concept_Anchors_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">② Concept Anchors</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"#③ Initiatives (Goal-Oriented Modules)\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#③_Initiatives_(Goal-Oriented_Modules)_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">③ Initiatives (Goal-Oriented Modules)</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"#④ Product Groupings\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#④_Product_Groupings_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">④ Product Groupings</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"#⑤ Product Destinations (Transactional Pages)\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#⑤_Product_Destinations_(Transactional_Pages)_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">⑤ Product Destinations (Transactional Pages)</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"#⑥ Standard Pages\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#⑥_Standard_Pages_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">⑥ Standard Pages</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"#⑦ Listing Pages\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#⑦_Listing_Pages_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">⑦ Listing Pages</a>\nInformation Architecture\n<br><a data-href=\"#How These Pages Associate with Each Other\" href=\"work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/strategic-glossary-of-page-concepts-in-acc.org.html#How_These_Pages_Associate_with_Each_Other_0\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">How These Pages Associate with Each Other</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"#General I.A.

To maintain the established design system, use the provided color swatches, Illustrator panels, and graphic, character, and paragraph styles.These design enforcements support a consistent experience and are reader-focused, making the algorithms easy to read, understand, and provide valuable information like the CORs (Class of Recommendation). The algorithm is mostly monochromatic, with a focus on high contrast separation between the background and text to improve readability. COR colors are used specifically to highlight important information, ensuring that critical details stand out for the reader.\nNode and Decision Symbols: Always use the predefined symbols for nodes and decisions. These symbols are already designed to align with the correct COR color and shape, ensuring that each element is visually consistent and recognizable. Line and Label Symbols: Use the predefined line and label symbols to maintain consistent visual direction and clarity. Lines such as \"YES,\" \"NO,\" and the avoid markers are standardized for effective communication. Node Binders: Use symbols like NODE BINDER -- AND, NODE BINDER -- OR, and NODE BINDER -- ANY to represent logical connections between nodes clearly. This ensures that all decision junctions are presented in a consistent manner. Line Styles: Lines connecting nodes are styled consistently with arrows indicating the direction of flow. There are no variations in line thickness. Text Alignment: Text within each node should be aligned to the left and vertically centered to enhance readability. Legend Placement: Place the legend in the top right corner by default. If there is insufficient space, use the bottom right, followed by the bottom left. Legends should never be placed in the top left. Refer to the finished example to understand how these elements work together to create a consistent and branded algorithm design.The Illustrator file is set up with an artboard named \"Toolkit,\" which contains all the essential elements for designing guideline algorithms. This toolkit includes:\nSymbols: Predefined symbols such as data nodes, decision shapes, and other graphic elements. Graphic Styles: Graphic Styles are used for line styles and arrows, applying the consistent look and feel to lines and arrows based on a simple line in Illustrator. Character Styles: The character styles in the file include options for titles, labels, node content, and more. Use the Title style for main headings, Zone Label for section labels, and Node Regular or Node Strong for content within nodes. There are also specific styles for COR Labels to ensure that Class of Recommendation values stand out appropriately. Paragraph Styles: Utilize the Paragraph Styles to maintain consistency across body text and labels. For instance, use Node Text for text within nodes and Footnotes for any additional information provided at the bottom of the algorithm. The Line Labels style ensures all directional labels (e.g., \"YES,\" \"NO\") are clearly formatted. Color Swatches: The approved color palette for decision points and node types. Toolkit Artboard: Refer to the toolkit artboard to quickly access and apply these elements. Use the Toolkit: Start by using the elements provided in the toolkit artboard to maintain consistency. Smart Alignment: Use smart guides to align elements properly, ensuring nodes align in the same column for a clean and professional layout. Apply Character and Paragraph Styles: Always use the predefined character and paragraph styles to ensure that text formatting is consistent. This includes titles, labels, footnotes, and node content. Consistent use of styles helps maintain a reader-friendly experience and aligns with branding standards.\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#project"],"headers":[{"heading":"Algorithms for Guidelines - Consistent Branded Design Experience","level":1,"id":"Algorithms_for_Guidelines_-_Consistent_Branded_Design_Experience_0"},{"heading":"Design Overview","level":2,"id":"Design_Overview_0"},{"heading":"Designing an Algorithm","level":2,"id":"Designing_an_Algorithm_0"},{"heading":"How the File is Set Up","level":2,"id":"How_the_File_is_Set_Up_0"},{"heading":"Tips &amp; Tricks","level":2,"id":"Tips_&_Tricks_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/algorithm/algorithm-read-me.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1736177486043,"modifiedTime":1741717890703,"sourceSize":4341,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/Algorithm/Algorithm Read Me.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/algorithm/algorithm-read-me.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":219,"backlinks":["work/acc/projects/algorithm-design-system.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/algorithm/color-test.html":{"title":"Color Test","icon":"","description":"Most of the document is based on a white background so it is cheaper to print.

This project brought structure and coherence by introducing a comprehensive set of design standards, visual language, and reusable assets. The system empowers the Guidelines team to create algorithms that are easier to read, understand, and implement in clinical practice.A key enhancement was the introduction of a new color palette designed for accessibility. The updated palette ensures higher contrast ratios for better on-screen readability and preserves meaning when printed in black-and-white—critical for clinicians who rely on hard copies or monochrome prints.This redesign was informed by research conducted two years ago(focus groups by Rowena and Surveys by everyone) at the Annual Scientific Session, which showed that while ACC’s algorithms were trusted for their accuracy, ESC’s were more widely used due to their visual appeal. Our goal was to close that gap—and exceed it—by making our algorithms not just accurate, but also engaging and user-friendly.After a year of workshops and refinement, the finalized system is now being implemented. Lauren P. is currently applying it to the forthcoming HBP Guideline, which will be the first to fully reflect this new visual and structural standard.This has resulted in improved capturing from workgroups who are now using it. Positive feedback from the review committees. &nbsp; And the post production vendors have remarked a faster to market production time to &nbsp;make interactives from the algorithms.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/algorithm/project-description.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1753113716591,"modifiedTime":1753973344215,"sourceSize":1861,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/Algorithm/Project Description.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/algorithm/project-description.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":221,"backlinks":[],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/ccke/ccke-content-proposal.html":{"title":"CCKE Content Proposal","icon":"","description":"This is an audit of the two Product Pages that currently have overlapping content. Below is a numbered list of the two pages, and how they will be referred to thereafter:\nCertified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S.:\na. Referred to as CVTeam.\nCertified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S.:\na. Referred to as Clinician-OUS.\nThe two pages—\"CVTEAM\" and \"Clinician-OUS\"—contain significant overlap and some type-specific content. The recommendations below aim to streamline and unify both pages for clarity and ease of navigation for users. Content can be categorized into three groups: identical, very similar, and type-specific. The goal is to consolidate identical content, modify the similar content to fit both groups where applicable, and keep type-specific information targeted to the specific audience. Unify Duplicate Sections: Many sections across both pages have the same or nearly identical content, such as \"How Will the Exam be Administered?\", \"What is the Reliability of This Exam?\", and \"What Topics Are Included on This Exam?\". Consolidate these into one central resource (such as a FAQ) that is shared between both audiences. Keep Persona-Specific Details Separate: Type-specific content should be kept separate where necessary to ensure that information remains relevant and directly applicable to each audience, e.g., \"Who's Eligible to Take ACC's Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE)?\" where eligibility criteria differ for NPs/PAs versus physicians. Create Cross-References to Simplify Navigation: Provide hyperlinks between shared sections and persona-specific pages to make it easier for users to navigate between general and specific content. This will improve the overall user journey by reducing the likelihood of confusion between similar content. <img alt=\"Pasted image 20241030170446.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20241030170446.png\" target=\"_self\">The proposed AI structure helps streamline the content by focusing each page's role to enhance user experience, reduce redundancy, and provide clear navigation pathways even when users arrive at the wrong page variant.\nProduct Page: Centralizes key exam-related content, making it the first point of reference for all users. It focuses on eligibility, application processes, exam administration, and a general overview, ensuring consistency and reducing noise by keeping shared content unified.\nPersona Detail Pages: Targeted at specific roles, these pages provide tailored details for eligibility, exam dates, preparation resources, and other specifics. By keeping type-specific information on dedicated pages, users can easily navigate to content relevant to their background without sifting through unrelated details.\nFAQ Page: Acts as a shared resource for questions that apply to both personas. This page will address common concerns, minimizing redundancy and providing a quick, centralized place for users to find general information. Hyperlinks will be used to direct users to persona-specific details where necessary.\nThis structure is designed to help users who might have arrived at the wrong variant by guiding them to the right section, thus reducing user frustration and improving satisfaction.Consolidation of Identical and Very Similar Content: Move sections that are largely duplicated to a shared FAQ or product page. These sections include \"How Will the Exam be Administered?\", \"What is the Reliability of This Exam?\", and \"Does the CCKE Offer a Credential?\" Doing so will help reduce maintenance efforts while also improving consistency for users. Maintaining Persona-Specific Content: For sections that are specific to either \"Clinician-OUS\" or \"CVTeam,\" create separate Persona Detail Pages. For instance, eligibility requirements, submission details, and exam dates vary between the two audiences. Keeping these sections separate but cross-referencing shared content will reduce confusion while allowing both pages to provide specialized information. Use of Accordion Components: Keep the collapsible accordion structure to allow users to access content in manageable portions, making the pages less overwhelming. Ensure that each accordion component has consistent headings and styles across both \"CVTeam\" and \"Clinician-OUS\" pages. Navigation Enhancements: To further reduce confusion, provide clear links at the end of shared sections like \"How Much Does This Exam Cost?\" to direct users to persona-specific details. If the two products cannot be merged, it is recommended to rebrand one or both products to ensure they are distinguishable and reduce confusion. The proposed rebranding involves the following: Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S. (CVTeam): Maintain existing branding, but emphasize that this version of the exam is specifically for U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants. Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S. (Clinician-OUS): Rebrand this product to differentiate it more clearly from CVTeam. Consider adding a geographic or professional distinction to the name, such as \"International Cardiovascular Knowledge Certification\" or \"Certified Cardiovascular Competence for International Physicians\". Visual and Structural Distinction: Introduce distinct color schemes or visual markers on both product pages to signal the difference at a glance.\nUpdate headers and footers to clearly mention the audience for each product, e.g., \"For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S.\" vs. \"For U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants\". Clarify Naming Across All Communications: Update all marketing, email, and support documentation to ensure that users are consistently seeing the rebranded names.\nEnsure that cross-references between the products are explicit about the intended audience to avoid any ambiguity. The goal of the rebranding effort is to reduce confusion, particularly among members who may be unsure which certification is appropriate for their professional background. By creating a stronger distinction between the two certifications, ACC can improve user satisfaction and reduce the potential for misapplication.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#project"],"headers":[{"heading":"Overview of Audit and Cleaning Notes:","level":1,"id":"Overview_of_Audit_and_Cleaning_Notes_0"},{"heading":"General Cleaning and Consolidation Recommendations:","level":3,"id":"General_Cleaning_and_Consolidation_Recommendations_0"},{"heading":"Cleaned Up Content with Suggested Placement:","level":3,"id":"Cleaned_Up_Content_with_Suggested_Placement_0"},{"heading":"<h3 data-heading=\"Integration with Proposed AI Structure:\" dir=\"auto\">Integration with Proposed AI Structure:</h3>","level":3,"id":"###_Integration_with_Proposed_AI_Structure_0"},{"heading":"Proposed Rebranding Effort (If Products Cannot Be Merged)","level":3,"id":"Proposed_Rebranding_Effort_(If_Products_Cannot_Be_Merged)_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":".","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/ccke/ccke-content-proposal.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":["_pastedimages/pasted-image-20241030170446.html"],"createdTime":1730733213588,"modifiedTime":1731018557570,"sourceSize":19120,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/CCKE/CCKE Content Proposal.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/ccke/ccke-content-proposal.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":223,"backlinks":["work/acc/projects/ccke.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/ccke/content-rewrite.html":{"title":"Content Rewrite","icon":"","description":"The Exam is timed and it is important that you give yourself enough time to finish it during the exam window.The test and the questions are timed.

Conversions with Integrated Marketing","icon":"","description":"Email MarketingHere’s a streamlined process flow for utilizing Direct Marketing Emails, Social Posts, and Web Marketing to drive users to landing pages with single goal CTAs, optimizing for conversion:\n<img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173228.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173228.png\" target=\"_self\">\nObjective: Whether the goal is membership sign-up, promoting a specific product, or encouraging course enrollment, start with a clear and single-focused goal. Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173258.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173258.png\" target=\"_self\">\nPersonalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient. Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product. Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links. Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button. Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173344.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173344.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAwareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly. Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”. Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement. Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page. <br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click. <img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173411.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173411.png\" target=\"_self\"> Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment). Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's \"Join Now\", \"Sign Up\", or \"Purchase\". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal. Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience. Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”). Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173440.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173440.png\" target=\"_self\">\nTrack Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions. Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency. Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips). <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173458.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173458.png\" target=\"_self\"> Direct Email: Send an email to non-members emphasizing the value of membership (e.g., “Unlock exclusive access to resources, discounts, and courses”). Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to membership sign-up landing page. Social Media Post: Post a testimonial or success story from a current member, emphasizing the benefits. Clear CTA: “Learn More” → Redirect to landing page that further explains membership benefits. Website Banner Ad: Place a banner on relevant blog or content pages: “Become a Member Today and Get Access to Premium Courses”. Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to landing page optimized for membership sign-ups. By focusing on single-action CTAs, and maintaining consistent, clear messaging across all communication channels, this process maximizes the chances of conversion from email, social, and web marketing efforts.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173524.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173524.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#project"],"headers":[{"heading":"1.

This initiative, commencing after the Annual Meeting in April 2025, involves over twenty sections and will require our collective effort to achieve outstanding consistency and quality.Leading up to April 2025, Jackie, Laura, and I will concentrate on several key tasks to establish a solid foundation: Proof of Concept (POC): We will finalize a robust WIC POC to define our preferred tone, brevity, and structure. This benchmark will guide all pages and content styles. Content Access Guidelines: After cleaning up existing content, Jackie and I will draft clear guidelines delineating public-facing content from that exclusive to members. We'll circulate this initial draft to the Tiger team for insights. IT Development Planning: Armed with the POC, we will collaborate with leadership to outline and align on our anticipated IT development requirements for dynamic content and and the user onboarding logic. Content and Resources Collection: Our team will create an effective initiation script and a user-friendly content collection form to streamline the content-gathering process for our liaisons. This groundwork will empower us to seamlessly engage with staff liaisons following the Annual Meeting.Content collection for our Member Sections is scheduled to begin in April 2025. To optimize our resources, we will prioritize which sections to revamp first. Kickoff Meeting/Workshop: We will introduce the dedicated project team and the creative assets needed for content collection. Matt and Jackie will lead a workshop to showcase an illustrative section while demonstrating the collection form. Content Collection Responsibilities: Each section team will undertake the content collection and refactoring, utilizing the WIC POC as their guide. Our oversight will ensure alignment and quality throughout the process. Completion of Content: Once content is gathered, our coordination team will collaborate with MarCom to generate essential images for prominent features. Quality Assurance: A JIRA ticket will be created to document the creation of the newly refactored Member Section, ensuring transparency and tracking. Editorial Review: Based on our priorities, the completed section will be processed, entered into Author, reviewed, and then published for production. Repeat for All Sections: This process will be repeated systematically for all remaining sections. Early 2025: Finalize the POC, establish clear content guidelines, plan IT development, and prepare liaison resources.\nPost-Annual Meeting (April 2025): Launch engagement with liaisons and section teams to kick off content collection.\nIf you have any questions or need further insights on this exciting project, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Together, we can create an exceptional experience for our members.Looking forward to our collaboration,\nMatt &amp; Jackie","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Preliminary Work (Now until Early 2025)","level":3,"id":"Preliminary_Work_(Now_until_Early_2025)_0"},{"heading":"Content Collection","level":3,"id":"Content_Collection_0"},{"heading":"Timeline and Next Steps","level":3,"id":"Timeline_and_Next_Steps_0"}],"links":[],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/projects/member-sections/project-build-outline.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1736177486081,"modifiedTime":1741718008852,"sourceSize":3356,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Projects/Member Sections/Project Build Outline.md","exportPath":"work/acc/projects/member-sections/project-build-outline.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":239,"backlinks":["work/acc/projects/member-sections.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/projects/member-sections/section-personas.html":{"title":"Section Personas","icon":"","description":"Here are all four personas, incorporating the updated preferences: Name: Emma Wright Demographics: 42, Cardiologist, Busy Practitioner Engagement Style:\nEmma frequently visits the member section but rarely interacts. She uses the platform to gain exposure to new ideas and practices outside the confines of her immediate professional environment. Though she doesn't contribute to discussions, she values the ability to access diverse perspectives and knowledge that she might not encounter in her day-to-day practice. Motivations: Access to a broader range of insights and innovations outside her specialized work environment Exposure to emerging trends and interdisciplinary practices without the pressure to engage Staying up-to-date on best practices in cardiovascular care across a wide professional spectrum Frustrations: Feels disconnected from the broader community, as she does not actively contribute Finds the structure of the member section limiting in how it presents different perspectives Opportunities for Engagement: Tailored content that highlights interdisciplinary approaches and innovations Encouraging passive participation through features like recommended reading based on emerging trends Exposure to discussions and webinars that broaden her view outside her regular practice area Name: David Chen Demographics: 34, Nurse Practitioner, Cardiovascular Specialty Engagement Style:\nDavid sees the member section as a much-needed space where he can connect with like-minded professionals who share his focus on cardiovascular care. In his current professional environment, he often feels isolated due to the niche nature of his specialty. The member section provides him with a sense of belonging, allowing him to engage in meaningful discussions, contribute his expertise, and exchange ideas with others who understand his field. Motivations: Building connections with professionals who share his specialty and interests Participating in discussions and sharing his experiences to contribute to the collective knowledge of his \"tribe\" Seeking out a supportive community that is not readily available in his current work environment Frustrations: Lacks opportunities for collaboration and shared experiences within his immediate workplace Difficulty finding deeper engagement in discussions that go beyond surface-level topics Opportunities for Engagement: Dedicated spaces or groups within the platform that focus specifically on his specialty, fostering a \"tribe\" mentality Opportunities for collaboration on case studies or joint projects with other specialists Recognition for contributing to niche discussions, further building a sense of community and validation Name: Lisa Patel Demographics: 48, Physician Assistant, Balancing Multiple Roles Engagement Style:\nLisa uses the member section to break free from the professional silos of her work. When she engages, she actively seeks out networking opportunities with peers from diverse backgrounds. These connections help her gain insights and ideas outside the boundaries of her current professional setting. Her engagement comes in bursts, focused primarily on meeting new people and exchanging knowledge. Motivations: Networking with professionals from various specialties to broaden her perspective Engaging with peers to exchange innovative ideas and learn from different fields Building relationships that provide exposure to new methods, outside of her regular clinical environment Frustrations: Difficulty maintaining new contacts and finding ongoing opportunities to interact Feels her access to new ideas is limited during inactive periods, making her engagement feel sporadic and siloed Opportunities for Engagement: Networking events or peer-matching features that introduce her to professionals from outside her usual circles Opportunities to connect with members who share interdisciplinary expertise and experiences Features to maintain relationships, such as saved connections or discussion prompts that encourage ongoing dialogue Name: Dr. Marcus Johnson Demographics: 55, Senior Cardiologist, Thought Leader Engagement Style:\nMarcus is deeply invested in shaping the future of the member section. He not only contributes content but also actively influences how the site is structured and enriched. His vision is to create a space that fosters professional growth and collaboration. Marcus collaborates with the website's administrators, suggesting improvements and helping steer the development of new features that benefit all members. Motivations: Helping guide the direction of the section to better serve the community Mentoring others and enriching the knowledge base with high-quality content Developing a collaborative space that encourages deeper member engagement and professional growth Frustrations: Limited ability to influence strategic decisions about the section’s development Lacks advanced tools for proposing or implementing changes to the website structure and content curation Opportunities for Engagement: Opportunities to join advisory boards or task forces that influence the site’s growth and development Advanced content management tools that allow him to contribute strategically and enrich the member experience Leadership roles in shaping and curating specific content areas or discussion threads ","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"1.

Each page is a chapter of the initiative's story, aimed to guide users to a strategically defined conversion point.

It features a text-free, richly layered hero image, a compelling call-to-action (CTA), and supportive information to propel the narrative.

This combination piques user interest and encourages action. <br>Sub-Pages and Micro Branding: Consistent branding is carried through to each sub-page via a smaller image that reflects the \"flair\" of the home page's hero image.

While they adhere to most of ACC.org's branding guidelines, their unique design and structure allow them to serve as focused resources for users.However, creating a microsite is not always advisable due to costs and other considerations. It's generally reserved for significant initiatives that are notably important, brandable, unique, complex, and self-contained. In such instances, a microsite can offer significant value.

Acting semi-independently from the main site, it caters to a niche audience or user need that benefits from a narrowed scope and tailored options, away from the broader offerings of the main site.The microsite adopts the fundamental branding guidelines of ACC.org while introducing its unique design, structure, and organization. This concentration of tailored information and user actions makes it an effective tool for engagement.\nFocused Content: Microsites allow you to create content that is highly targeted towards a specific audience or topic. This can help improve user engagement and conversion rates for that specific topic or audience.\nProduct Brand Alterations: Microsites provide an opportunity to apply branding and design strategies unique to the product. Campaign-Specific Messaging: Microsites can be an effective tool for unique marketing campaigns or product launches, where a dedicated site can deliver a focused message.\nFast Deployment: Microsites can typically be augmented and launched more quickly than adding substantial new sections to an existing site. Most often this work is bespoke and one off.\nFlexibility: Microsites can be easily tweaked or shut down without affecting the rest of the company's web presence.\nUser Experience: Microsites can offer a more streamlined and targeted user experience, leading to improved customer satisfaction and conversion rates for a product.\nImproved Tracking: It may be easier to track the effectiveness of a specific campaign or audience through a microsite, as analytics can be specifically tailored for the site. Independence: If different departments or branches of a company want to maintain a certain level of autonomy in their web presence, microsites can offer this independence.\nWhile microsites can be valuable tools, they also come with inherent challenges that can affect your digital strategy. These challenges underline the fact that while microsites can be effective for specific initiatives, they should be used judiciously and with clear purpose, given the potential costs involved.\nBrand Consistency: Operating multiple microsites can disrupt brand uniformity and recognition, causing customer confusion.\nIncreased Management Complexity: The operation and maintenance of various microsites amplify the complexity of website management, requiring additional resources. The bespoke nature of the code might also lead to problems during system upgrades.\nSEO Risks: Microsites could cannibalize the SEO value of the main site and end up competing with it in search results. User Navigation and Context Confusion: Due to their distinctive branding and self-contained nature, microsites can create navigation challenges for users. Moving between multiple microsites and the main site can lead to a disorienting user experience. This context-switching confusion is typically less prevalent in a single, unified site of the main site. Content Duplication: Managing content across the main sites and isolated microsites introduces the risk of duplication and subsequent issues with content upkeep, maintenance and SEO.\nTraffic Dilution: Traffic is dispersed across multiple microsites instead of being directed to one central site, leading to a dilution of traffic on the main site and less cross-site discovery.\nDiscoverability: If not directly linked or referenced from the main site, microsites may be more difficult for users to find.\nSustainability: Maintaining and updating numerous microsites over time can prove challenging, potentially resulting in outdated information.\n<br><a href=\".?query=tag:acc/org/microsite\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#acc/org/microsite\">#acc/org/microsite</a><br>\n<a href=\".?query=tag:acc/guidance\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#acc/guidance\">#acc/guidance</a><br>\n<a href=\".?query=tag:acc/ux\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#acc/ux\">#acc/ux</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Pros &amp; Cons","level":1,"id":"Pros_&_Cons_0"},{"heading":"Why use a Micro-Site","level":2,"id":"Why_use_a_Micro-Site_0"},{"heading":"Pros of Microsites:","level":2,"id":"Pros_of_Microsites_0"},{"heading":"The Negative Costs of a Microsite","level":2,"id":"The_Negative_Costs_of_a_Microsite_0"}],"links":["work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/microsites.html","?query=tag:acc/org/microsite","?query=tag:acc/guidance","?query=tag:acc/ux"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/pros-&-cons.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1689601151455,"modifiedTime":1689609516508,"sourceSize":3988,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/Microsites/Pros & Cons.md","exportPath":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/pros-&-cons.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":298,"backlinks":["work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/microsites.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/strategic-threshold-for-a-microsite.html":{"title":"Strategic Threshold for a Microsite","icon":"","description":"<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"Microsites\" data-href=\"Microsites\" href=\"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/microsites.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">← back to MicroSties</a>For our company, the use of microsites should be the exception rather than the rule. We should set high thresholds for what qualifies a topic or campaign for a separate microsite. Rather than creating a microsite, the default Generic Page approach should be utilized incorporated within the information architecture of our main site. Only when the content meets exceptionally stringent criteria—whether that's relevance, audience specificity, or uniqueness—should we consider the development of a standalone microsite. Specific Target Audience: Content needs to be tailored to a highly specific audience that can't be effectively targeted through the main site. Unique Campaign: The content should pertain to a unique, typically time-bound campaign that requires distinct messaging separate from the broader brand or company offerings. SEO Strategy: The microsite should have a clear, separate SEO strategy focused on keywords and topics not covered by the main site. User Experience: The microsite should offer a uniquely engaging user experience, such as an interactive product demo or immersive storytelling, that wouldn't fit well within the main site. Unique Functional Requirements: The microsite should require functionality not supported or feasible on the main site, such as a unique user registration process, specific eCommerce setup, or API integrations. New Product Launch: The content should relate to the launch of a new product or service that could benefit from focused attention and doesn't fit neatly into the existing site structure. Event Promotion: The content should promote a specific event that warrants its own promotional and informational space. Partnership or Collaboration: The microsite should be created for a joint venture, partnership, or collaboration with another entity, where separate branding and messaging is crucial. Geographic Specificity: The microsite should cater to a specific geographic market that has unique needs separate from the main audience. Cost-Benefit Analysis: There should be a clear financial and strategic advantage to creating the microsite, with projected benefits outweighing the costs of development, maintenance, and potential dilution of brand or SEO.\nDefined Lifespan: Each microsite should have a defined lifespan, whether short-term or long-term. This timeframe should align with its strategic objectives, such as ongoing updates or serving as a reference resource. The expected lifespan should justify its creation and separate maintenance, ensuring it brings value during its entire existence.\n<br><a href=\".?query=tag:acc/org/microsite\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#acc/org/microsite\">#acc/org/microsite</a><br>\n<a href=\".?query=tag:acc/guidance\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#acc/guidance\">#acc/guidance</a><br>\n<a href=\".?query=tag:acc/ux\" class=\"tag is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" data-href=\"#acc/ux\">#acc/ux</a>","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Required Threshold for Acceptance","level":2,"id":"Required_Threshold_for_Acceptance_0"},{"heading":"Strategic Reasons For Creation","level":2,"id":"Strategic_Reasons_For_Creation_0"},{"heading":"Considerations","level":2,"id":"Considerations_0"}],"links":["work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/microsites.html","?query=tag:acc/org/microsite","?query=tag:acc/guidance","?query=tag:acc/ux"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/strategic-threshold-for-a-microsite.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1689601151471,"modifiedTime":1689608311055,"sourceSize":2871,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/Microsites/Strategic Threshold for a Microsite.md","exportPath":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/strategic-threshold-for-a-microsite.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":299,"backlinks":["work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/microsites.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/current-analytics-running-on-project-scope.html":{"title":"Current Analytics running on Project Scope","icon":"","description":"Assignee: Analytics Team\nLabels: Google Analytics, Usage Report, Web TrafficWe need the Analytics team to generate a snapshot Google Analytics usage report for all content within [Defined Project Scope] on ACC.org.

The goal is to improve maintainability, performance, accessibility, and long-term sustainability while aligning with best practices in development, content management, and user experience.This process often involves:\nCode Optimization: Enhancing front-end and back-end code to improve efficiency, reduce technical debt, and ensure compliance with modern standards.\nContent Restructuring: Reviewing and reorganizing digital content within Sitecore or Sitefinity to streamline navigation, improve searchability, and eliminate redundancies.\nDesign &amp; UX Enhancements: Refining layouts, typography, and interaction patterns for better usability while maintaining consistency with ACC’s design systems, such as ARCHES and PaperCrane.\nPerformance Improvements: Optimizing page load times, reducing server requests, and implementing caching strategies to enhance user experience.\nIntegration &amp; API Updates: Ensuring seamless connectivity between ACC.org, CRM systems (ONECRM), and external platforms (HubSpot, analytics tools).\nSEO &amp; Analytics Refinement: Updating metadata, link structures, and tracking mechanisms to improve visibility and data accuracy.\nEach Refactor initiative is data-driven, with preliminary audits and analytics reports guiding decisions. The ultimate objective is to create a scalable, future-proof solution that enhances both user experience and backend manageability while preserving existing content and functionality.\n<a data-tooltip-position=\"top\" aria-label=\"https://whimsical.com/refactor-workflow-process-improved-version-8japDxeuPPjvJzSrjQk6ek\" data-href=\"https://whimsical.com/refactor-workflow-process-improved-version-8japDxeuPPjvJzSrjQk6ek\" href=\"https://whimsical.com/refactor-workflow-process-improved-version-8japDxeuPPjvJzSrjQk6ek\" class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Process Flow Diagram</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Pre Kickoff Collection Checklist\" href=\"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/pre-kickoff-collection-checklist.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Pre Kickoff Collection Checklist</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Refactor Process\" href=\"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/refactor-process.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Refactor Process</a>\n<br><a data-href=\"Post Launch Checklist\" href=\"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/post-launch-checklist.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Post Launch Checklist</a>\n","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Documents","level":2,"id":"Documents_0"}],"links":["work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/pre-kickoff-collection-checklist.html","work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/refactor-process.html","work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/post-launch-checklist.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/refactors.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1741885908806,"modifiedTime":1741889721454,"sourceSize":1915,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/Refactor/Refactors.md","exportPath":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/refactor/refactors.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":306,"backlinks":["work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/structure-&-guidance.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/spa/outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html":{"title":"Outline of Tickets for SPAs in Vue","icon":"","description":"\n<a data-href=\"Single Page Applications\" href=\"work/acc/jira/single-page-applications.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Single Page Applications</a> Ticket kicks all of this off\nDesign and Requirements\nTechnical Feasibility\nDesign Iteration Follow Up from Technical Feasibility\nBasic Application: Data &amp; API\nBasic Application: Page Construction, Code Branch, Page Access\nBasic Application: Vue APP SHELL\nBasic Application: Application Initiation.\nComponent Construction: 1 – Many Tickets\nApplication Specifics | Feature X scaffolding: 1 – Many Tickets\nApplication Integration with Components | Feature X Refinement with QA: 1 – Many Tickets\nThese types of tickets come in phases where many of the branches can work in partnership moving the designed application forward with some autonomy.These tickets are iterative and often are labeled the “Sprint 0” depending on the ask from the product owner and how developed the concept is before the team receives the project this will be iterative. Often this should be a set of meetings and reviews between the UX Team and Technical Architect and Front-End Senior Lead with responses sent back to the UX team and ultimately the Product Owner. Depending on how “Lean” you want to run the project this can be as lean as a rough sketch where the particulars are hashed out in the project to full-blown comps with requirement notes being captured in the Parent “Epic” Ticket. Initial talks of analytics should be talked about prompt the BL to reach out to the analytics team to establish this branch of the requirements.When the receiving team is comfortable with the clarity of the intended product this phase will break down the ask into dispersible tickets. Depending on the skill and resources these tickets can be sized appropriately for the team. Basic Application Construction can start on day one considering the scaffolding is fundamental to any other work.Independent work is brought together in this phase. It is common that co-working and JAD sessions occur in these tickets as team members bring together the individual efforts. There is no clean break of this phase to previous depending on the delivery it is common that a feature might go through all phases and be QA’d before other features are even started.Design Phase is the most prone to change. This phase should be mostly completed before the rest of the tasks should start. There is always reason, technical or just iterating over an experience that can cause changes to the design but if the team has a good idea of what is being built and rework will be reduced. The tenants of AGILE does allow for iteration so it is inevitable that rework or alteration will happen. Documenting for the team should migrate to comments on design documents because living design documents are costly and in the end are a non-production artifact. It is very important that the Technology Team (DEV &amp; UI Lead) break down the steps and familiarize themselves with the nuances of the features to intelligently question the design and highlight possible issues before alterations become more impactful to the timelines. QA at this point can even scaffold out User Tests on features during this step.Team review of the UX design of Project X. Highlight and Flag and Feasibility Changes and Iterate over them with the UX team. Team will submit a scaffolding of tickets to produce the Application. Details should include Data needs, Implementation Specifics, Analytics definitions, and Front-End Breakdown.These steps are mostly dependent on the previous and could be collapsed to a single ticket but the ambiguity of the Data API it is best to keep these tickets into separate tickets to utilize a wider base of resources.API &amp; Data Structures to support the application outline the data handshake and return results for App Build Team &amp; UI Team.A user may only visit the URL if the user is logged in. The page will do all needed steps to redirect the user through log in in needed and redirect the user back to the page after success. Define URL &amp; create the hosting page in Sitecore.A user should be able to visit a URL and have an application on that page respond to the visitor with the information it has available to it. Create the shell of the application and establish needed hooks to the data the application will know. This information is defined by the project but in the most basic definitions the application will know about the User, and possibly the URL and any query structures.When the user visits the application, and it is loaded the application will initiate and collect information through API calls to store any data that is needed to display information and formulate any actions needed for the user defined by the project.Components should follow the single tenant that they are only responsible for data passed to them and emitting their context. This separates concerns when the Application takes most of the features and components can stay agnostic.When creating components all new components will be created with the library’s project folder. If the team finds value for a specific component that is generic enough to be reusable across many applications, the component can be promoted to a common library folder. Be aware that common components require a greater level of flexibility and scope to make them bullet proof for generic consumption.Component tickets should encompass basic mutations that are needed for that component. Basic examples or mutations are Size, Location or Inclusion, Props (Data they will display), Validations, States, Etc. This should result in a Code Review and a Demo with UX Team and Product Owner. To reduce meeting overload, they can be grouped with other tickets or be deferred to the Feature Refinement TicketThe user should be able to see the data they need to see and interact with data as defined by the requirements this is known as feature. In many cases features can be scaffolded with their data and methods without the need of utilizing components. Operations of an application like looping, reductions, additions, removals, data hooks and server responses can be all worked out without the use of components.User should be able to do X Feature. For Example, “scaffold delete this line item from the list.” This will produce a data storage, list and methods and listeners that can be used to remove data from the list. This would also include any database API and deal with the response return updating the stored data of the list.Inclusion of components and refinement of the frontend features. These phases will “wire” data and properties to components into the application. Depending on the size of the application these can be broken down into Features, or Pages, or States. This is the moment where components are due from the front-end teams. The deployment of components can be more staggered if the team is more comfortable with constant deployments. The benefits of this would be a lister would be available much earlier in the development process but may need to be updated or rewired if changes to validation or data needs alter in the refinement process.User should be able to do X Feature in the AppFor Example, “A user by clicking on the delete button on a list item should delete it from the list.” Render a data list with the delete button. On the click add a listener to the application that will trigger the delete feature that has been scaffolded. QA this feature. Demo this Feature with UX Team and Product Owner.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Ticket Creation List","level":2,"id":"Ticket_Creation_List_0"},{"heading":"Parallel Tickets between Design, Front End, Backend","level":1,"id":"Parallel_Tickets_between_Design,_Front_End,_Backend_0"},{"heading":"Design + Requirements &amp; Technical Feasibility.","level":2,"id":"Design_+_Requirements_&_Technical_Feasibility._0"},{"heading":"Basic Application Construction | Application Specifics | Component Construction","level":2,"id":"Basic_Application_Construction_|_Application_Specifics_|_Component_Construction_0"},{"heading":"Application Integration with Components | QA | Demo","level":2,"id":"Application_Integration_with_Components_|_QA_|_Demo_0"},{"heading":"Design + Requirements &amp; Technical Feasibility","level":1,"id":"Design_+_Requirements_&_Technical_Feasibility_0"},{"heading":"Example Ticket(s):","level":4,"id":"Example_Ticket(s)_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Project Intake</strong>","level":4,"id":"**Project_Intake**_0"},{"heading":"<strong>Basic Application Construction</strong>","level":1,"id":"**Basic_Application_Construction**_0"},{"heading":"Example Ticket(s):","level":3,"id":"Example_Ticket(s)_1"},{"heading":"Data &amp; API","level":4,"id":"Data_&_API_0"},{"heading":"Page Access","level":4,"id":"Page_Access_0"},{"heading":"App SHELL","level":4,"id":"App_SHELL_0"},{"heading":"App Initiation","level":4,"id":"App_Initiation_0"},{"heading":"Component Construction","level":1,"id":"Component_Construction_0"},{"heading":"Example Ticket(s):","level":3,"id":"Example_Ticket(s)_2"},{"heading":"Component X","level":4,"id":"Component_X_0"},{"heading":"Application Specifics","level":1,"id":"Application_Specifics_0"},{"heading":"Example Ticket(s):","level":3,"id":"Example_Ticket(s)_3"},{"heading":"Feature X scaffolding","level":3,"id":"Feature_X_scaffolding_0"},{"heading":"Application Integration with Components","level":1,"id":"Application_Integration_with_Components_0"},{"heading":"Example Ticket(s):","level":3,"id":"Example_Ticket(s)_4"},{"heading":"Feature X Refinement with QA","level":4,"id":"Feature_X_Refinement_with_QA_0"}],"links":["work/acc/jira/single-page-applications.html"],"author":"","coverImageURL":"","fullURL":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/spa/outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html","pathToRoot":"../../../..","attachments":[],"createdTime":1706285155331,"modifiedTime":1741889439165,"sourceSize":8261,"sourcePath":"Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/SPA/Outline of Tickets for SPAs in Vue.md","exportPath":"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/spa/outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html","showInTree":true,"treeOrder":308,"backlinks":["work/acc/jira/single-page-applications.html"],"type":"markdown"},"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/story-writing/story-first-content.html":{"title":"Story First Content","icon":"","description":"<a data-href=\"Page Creation Guidance\" href=\"work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/page-creation-guidance.html\" class=\"internal-link\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Page Creation Guidance</a>Focus the User- Always write to the goal of the page or task of the initiative.

Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173258.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173258.png\" target=\"_self\">\nPersonalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient. Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product. Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links. Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button. Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173344.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173344.png\" target=\"_self\">\nAwareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly. Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”. Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement. Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page. <br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click. <img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173411.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173411.png\" target=\"_self\"> Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment). Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's \"Join Now\", \"Sign Up\", or \"Purchase\". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal. Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience. Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”). Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email. <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173440.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173440.png\" target=\"_self\">\nTrack Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions. Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency. Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips). <br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173458.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173458.png\" target=\"_self\"> Direct Email: Send an email to non-members emphasizing the value of membership (e.g., “Unlock exclusive access to resources, discounts, and courses”). Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to membership sign-up landing page. Social Media Post: Post a testimonial or success story from a current member, emphasizing the benefits. Clear CTA: “Learn More” → Redirect to landing page that further explains membership benefits. Website Banner Ad: Place a banner on relevant blog or content pages: “Become a Member Today and Get Access to Premium Courses”. Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to landing page optimized for membership sign-ups. By focusing on single-action CTAs, and maintaining consistent, clear messaging across all communication channels, this process maximizes the chances of conversion from email, social, and web marketing efforts.<br><img alt=\"Pasted image 20240924173524.png\" src=\"_pastedimages/pasted-image-20240924173524.png\" target=\"_self\">","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":["#project"],"headers":[{"heading":"1.

However, I have come to realize the immense detriment I have been doing to the strategic approach to content creation by skipping to the UI answer. Instead of merely using 'Styled UI' to reshape, mutate, and hide content, we should focus on enhancing the content to bolster the user experience by solving the underlying issues that users might face with the content that was initially delivered.I have a different opinion on why we shouldn't create wireframes this early in a project. For the sake of speed, we, myself included, often skip the IA step, rushing to return to the client with wireframes. We then cleverly force their content into blocks and hidden areas on the page. The downside of internalizing the IA within the team and applying layouts and UI to content is that it directs our conversations with business lines toward solutions, rather than focusing on improving the content on the site. This undermines the value that IA discussions can bring. Jumping straight to UI wires limits our ability to challenge how we receive and refine raw content. We should at least help them transform it before we start applying UI.I want to ensure there is a moment when clients are encouraged and guided to evaluate the provided content. Content strategists can have the greatest impact by unlocking the potential for more effective and engaging content.Here is an example of what happens when we skip straight to UI. The wireframes react to the content as it is provided. In the team's review of overwhelming content, we responded by using accordions in the UI to hide excess information. This was a superficial fix that masked the issue—that the content was too lengthy and not concise. No changes were made to the content itself because we had already hidden it.Now we have introduced a situation where our users are forced into a discovery mode, and we haven't solved the problem that the content was too much or not aligned with the actual goals of the page.To maximize the effectiveness of content, we need to change our approach. Instead of rushing into UI design, we should follow a structured process:\nContent Evaluation: Review the content before doing any design work. Understand the purpose of the content and whether it aligns with the project's goals.\nInformation Architecture (IA) Application: Use IA to refine, organize, and simplify the content into a logical structure. Ensure that the content is easily navigable and user-friendly.\nContent Transformation: Apply appropriate hierarchies and organize the text logically. If necessary, split the content across multiple pages to make it more digestible. This should be a word document\nYou can outline that content is either series on the page or is in parallel.\nShould denote page breaks and how it is wired between pages. Content Presentation: Share the revised content with the client. Encourage them to review it in a Word document format so they can engage with the material and provide feedback.\nContent Refinement: Based on client feedback, refine the content further. Make sure it is concise, clear, and aligned with the project’s objectives.\nUI Design: Only after finalizing the content should we begin designing the UI. At this stage, the content will be well-organized, aligned with user goals, and ready to be integrated into the page layout.\nBy following these steps, we ensure that the content drives the design, not the other way around. This structured approach leads to better user experiences and more effective communication.\nWhere does this go?\nShould this be another page?\nWhat is this content saying?\nShould we hide this from the user?\nWhat is the point of this page?\nWhat are the goals, and does this content support them?\nLet’s encourage our clients to review the content in a Word document. It’s important for them to read through the information and share their thoughts. This step is crucial to ensure that the content matches the project’s goals and is easy for users to understand. As content strategists, we should lead this conversation by presenting our findings and showing our dedication to delivering top-quality content.Only when we have finalized the content can we move on to page designs and work on the UI.","aliases":[],"inlineTags":[],"frontmatterTags":[],"headers":[{"heading":"Background","level":2,"id":"Background_0"},{"heading":"Theory","level":2,"id":"Theory_0"},{"heading":"The \"Old Way\"
