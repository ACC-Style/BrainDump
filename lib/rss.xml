There are not resubscribe flows because not built in 1crm.<br>
The rub is that the subscriptions types show up on the renew page.<br>
1CRM opt-ins do not matching the opt-ins from higher logic. Suggest going into the delta from 1crm and higher logic.

Before I start this, I want to ask you to "love this for 5 minutes," then you can react.<br>In the act of working with clients, we often take the content documents we are offered, and our reaction to doing IA is to take that content and shoehorn it into UI to satisfy the client.<br><br>For years and possibly decades, I have taken content documents and shaved off a word or two. However, I have come to realize the immense detriment I have been doing to the strategic approach to content creation by skipping to the UI answer. Instead of merely using 'Styled UI' to reshape, mutate, and hide content, we should focus on enhancing the content to bolster the user experience by solving the underlying issues that users might face with the content that was initially delivered.<br><br>I have a different opinion on why we shouldn't create wireframes this early in a project. For the sake of speed, we, myself included, often skip the IA step, rushing to return to the client with wireframes. We then cleverly force their content into blocks and hidden areas on the page. The downside of internalizing the IA within the team and applying layouts and UI to content is that it directs our conversations with business lines toward solutions, rather than focusing on improving the content on the site. This undermines the value that IA discussions can bring. Jumping straight to UI wires limits our ability to challenge how we receive and refine raw content. We should at least help them transform it before we start applying UI.<br>I want to ensure there is a moment when clients are encouraged and guided to evaluate the provided content. Content strategists can have the greatest impact by unlocking the potential for more effective and engaging content.<br><br>Here is an example of what happens when we skip straight to UI. The wireframes react to the content as it is provided. In the team's review of overwhelming content, we responded by using accordions in the UI to hide excess information. This was a superficial fix that masked the issue—that the content was too lengthy and not concise. No changes were made to the content itself because we had already hidden it.<br>Now we have introduced a situation where our users are forced into a discovery mode, and we haven't solved the problem that the content was too much or not aligned with the actual goals of the page.<br><br>To maximize the effectiveness of content, we need to change our approach. Instead of rushing into UI design, we should follow a structured process:<br>
<br>Content Evaluation: Review the content before doing any design work. Understand the purpose of the content and whether it aligns with the project's goals.
<br>Information Architecture (IA) Application: Use IA to refine, organize, and simplify the content into a logical structure. Ensure that the content is easily navigable and user-friendly.
<br>Content Transformation: Apply appropriate hierarchies and organize the text logically. If necessary, split the content across multiple pages to make it more digestible.

<br>This should be a word document
<br>You can outline that content is either series on the page or is in parallel.
<br>Should denote page breaks and how it is wired between pages.


<br>Content Presentation: Share the revised content with the client. Encourage them to review it in a Word document format so they can engage with the material and provide feedback.
<br>Content Refinement: Based on client feedback, refine the content further. Make sure it is concise, clear, and aligned with the project’s objectives.
<br>UI Design: Only after finalizing the content should we begin designing the UI. At this stage, the content will be well-organized, aligned with user goals, and ready to be integrated into the page layout.
<br>By following these steps, we ensure that the content drives the design, not the other way around. This structured approach leads to better user experiences and more effective communication.<br>
<br>Where does this go?

 <br>Email Marketing<br>Here’s a streamlined process flow for utilizing Direct Marketing Emails, Social Posts, and Web Marketing to drive users to landing pages with single goal CTAs, optimizing for conversion:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240924173228.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173228.png"><br><br>
<br>Objective: Whether the goal is membership sign-up, promoting a specific product, or encouraging course enrollment, start with a clear and single-focused goal.<br>

<br>Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173258.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173258.png"><br><br>
<br>Personalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient.<br>

<br>Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product.<br>

<br>Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links.

<br>Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button.<br>



<br>Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173344.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173344.png"><br><br>
<br>Awareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly.<br>

<br>Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”.<br>

<br>Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement.<br>

<br>Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page.<br>

<br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click.
  <img alt="Pasted image 20240924173411.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173411.png">
<br><br>
<br>Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment).<br>

<br><br>
<br>Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's "Join Now", "Sign Up", or "Purchase". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal.<br>

<br>Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience.<br>

<br>Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”).<br>

<br>Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173440.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173440.png"><br><br>
<br>Track Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions.<br>

<br>Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency.<br>

<br>Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips).<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173458.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173458.png"><br><br>
<br>
Direct Email:

<br>Send an email to non-members emphasizing the value of membership (e.g., “Unlock exclusive access to resources, discounts, and courses”).<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to membership sign-up landing page.<br>



<br>
Social Media Post:

<br>Post a testimonial or success story from a current member, emphasizing the benefits.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Learn More” → Redirect to landing page that further explains membership benefits.<br>



<br>
Website Banner Ad:

<br>Place a banner on relevant blog or content pages: “Become a Member Today and Get Access to Premium Courses”.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to landing page optimized for membership sign-ups.<br>



<br>By focusing on single-action CTAs, and maintaining consistent, clear messaging across all communication channels, this process maximizes the chances of conversion from email, social, and web marketing efforts.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173524.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173524.png">]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\thoughts\maximize-conversions-with-integrated-marketing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Thoughts/Maximize Conversions with Integrated Marketing.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:26 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173228.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173228.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wendy.]]></title><description><![CDATA[

In the first sentence or area of the page the user should easily tell the action they should take.  And every piece of content should support, educate, or compel the user to act upon the task of the page. <br>Reduce - Reductive writing is best online users shy away from long blurbs of text.<br>
>>>>>>> 4db61ff (just checking in)
Reuse - Don't repeat similar or same blocks of text or content. If there are reasons for content to be used in multiple areas - link to it, or pattern it as a resource that users an engage with if they need it.<br>
Recycle- The title of the page you are linking to is usually not enough to be engaging. <br>
<br>Put the link within the text of the page,
<br>rewrite the hook to get users to the page by lifting up concepts and reasons for the user to engage with the link to navigate to it.
<br>Breaking a part the titles and content  so it is easier to scan. For Example Name of the doctor, concept of content, and type of content distinguished by style allows users to faster then it all written out as single line.

<br>Application Integration with Components | Feature X Refinement with QA: 1 – Many Tickets
<<<<<<< HEAD
<br><br><br>These types of tickets come in phases where many of the branches can work in partnership moving the designed application forward with some autonomy.<br><br>These tickets are iterative and often are labeled the “Sprint 0” depending on the ask from the product owner and how developed the concept is before the team receives the project this will be iterative. Often this should be a set of meetings and reviews between the UX Team and Technical Architect and Front-End Senior Lead with responses sent back to the UX team and ultimately the Product Owner. Depending on how “Lean” you want to run the project this can be as lean as a rough sketch where the particulars are hashed out in the project to full-blown comps with requirement notes being captured in the Parent “Epic” Ticket. Initial talks of analytics should be talked about prompt the BL to reach out to the analytics team to establish this branch of the requirements.<br><br>When the receiving team is comfortable with the clarity of the intended product this phase will break down the ask into dispersible tickets. Depending on the skill and resources these tickets can be sized appropriately for the team. Basic Application Construction can start on day one considering the scaffolding is fundamental to any other work.<br><br>Independent work is brought together in this phase. It is common that co-working and JAD sessions occur in these tickets as team members bring together the individual efforts. There is no clean break of this phase to previous depending on the delivery it is common that a feature might go through all phases and be QA’d before other features are even started.<br><br><br>Design Phase is the most prone to change. This phase should be mostly completed before the rest of the tasks should start. There is always reason, technical or just iterating over an experience that can cause changes to the design but if the team has a good idea of what is being built and rework will be reduced. The tenants of AGILE does allow for iteration so it is inevitable that rework or alteration will happen. Documenting for the team should migrate to comments on design documents because living design documents are costly and in the end are a non-production artifact. It is very important that the Technology Team (DEV &amp; UI Lead) break down the steps and familiarize themselves with the nuances of the features to intelligently question the design and highlight possible issues before alterations become more impactful to the timelines. QA at this point can even scaffold out User Tests on features during this step.<br><br><br>Team review of the UX design of Project X. Highlight and Flag and Feasibility Changes and Iterate over them with the UX team. Team will submit a scaffolding of tickets to produce the Application. Details should include Data needs, Implementation Specifics, Analytics definitions, and Front-End Breakdown.<br><br><br>These steps are mostly dependent on the previous and could be collapsed to a single ticket but the ambiguity of the Data API it is best to keep these tickets into separate tickets to utilize a wider base of resources.<br><br><br>API &amp; Data Structures to support the application outline the data handshake and return results for App Build Team &amp; UI Team.<br><br>A user may only visit the URL if the user is logged in. The page will do all needed steps to redirect the user through log in in needed and redirect the user back to the page after success. Define URL &amp; create the hosting page in Sitecore.<br><br>A user should be able to visit a URL and have an application on that page respond to the visitor with the information it has available to it. Create the shell of the application and establish needed hooks to the data the application will know. This information is defined by the project but in the most basic definitions the application will know about the User, and possibly the URL and any query structures.<br><br>When the user visits the application, and it is loaded the application will initiate and collect information through API calls to store any data that is needed to display information and formulate any actions needed for the user defined by the project.<br><br><br>Components should follow the single tenant that they are only responsible for data passed to them and emitting their context. This separates concerns when the Application takes most of the features and components can stay agnostic.<br>When creating components all new components will be created with the library’s project folder. If the team finds value for a specific component that is generic enough to be reusable across many applications, the component can be promoted to a common library folder. Be aware that common components require a greater level of flexibility and scope to make them bullet proof for generic consumption.<br><br><br>Component tickets should encompass basic mutations that are needed for that component. Basic examples or mutations are Size, Location or Inclusion, Props (Data they will display), Validations, States, Etc. This should result in a Code Review and a Demo with UX Team and Product Owner. To reduce meeting overload, they can be grouped with other tickets or be deferred to the Feature Refinement Ticket<br><br><br>The user should be able to see the data they need to see and interact with data as defined by the requirements this is known as feature. In many cases features can be scaffolded with their data and methods without the need of utilizing components. Operations of an application like looping, reductions, additions, removals, data hooks and server responses can be all worked out without the use of components.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature. <br>For Example, “scaffold delete this line item from the list.” This will produce a data storage, list and methods and listeners that can be used to remove data from the list. This would also include any database API and deal with the response return updating the stored data of the list.<br><br><br>Inclusion of components and refinement of the frontend features. These phases will “wire” data and properties to components into the application. Depending on the size of the application these can be broken down into Features, or Pages, or States. This is the moment where components are due from the front-end teams. The deployment of components can be more staggered if the team is more comfortable with constant deployments. The benefits of this would be a lister would be available much earlier in the development process but may need to be updated or rewired if changes to validation or data needs alter in the refinement process.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature in the App<br>For Example, “A user by clicking on the delete button on a list item should delete it from the list.” Render a data list with the delete button. On the click add a listener to the application that will trigger the delete feature that has been scaffolded. QA this feature. Demo this Feature with UX Team and Product Owner.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/spa/outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/SPA/Outline of Tickets for SPAs in Vue.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 14 Mar 2025 17:32:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[html optimization]]></title><description><![CDATA[

=======
<br><br><br>These types of tickets come in phases where many of the branches can work in partnership moving the designed application forward with some autonomy.<br><br>These tickets are iterative and often are labeled the “Sprint 0” depending on the ask from the product owner and how developed the concept is before the team receives the project this will be iterative. Often this should be a set of meetings and reviews between the UX Team and Technical Architect and Front-End Senior Lead with responses sent back to the UX team and ultimately the Product Owner. Depending on how “Lean” you want to run the project this can be as lean as a rough sketch where the particulars are hashed out in the project to full-blown comps with requirement notes being captured in the Parent “Epic” Ticket. Initial talks of analytics should be talked about prompt the BL to reach out to the analytics team to establish this branch of the requirements.<br><br>When the receiving team is comfortable with the clarity of the intended product this phase will break down the ask into dispersible tickets. Depending on the skill and resources these tickets can be sized appropriately for the team. Basic Application Construction can start on day one considering the scaffolding is fundamental to any other work.<br><br>Independent work is brought together in this phase. It is common that co-working and JAD sessions occur in these tickets as team members bring together the individual efforts. There is no clean break of this phase to previous depending on the delivery it is common that a feature might go through all phases and be QA’d before other features are even started.<br><br><br>Design Phase is the most prone to change. This phase should be mostly completed before the rest of the tasks should start. There is always reason, technical or just iterating over an experience that can cause changes to the design but if the team has a good idea of what is being built and rework will be reduced. The tenants of AGILE does allow for iteration so it is inevitable that rework or alteration will happen. Documenting for the team should migrate to comments on design documents because living design documents are costly and in the end are a non-production artifact. It is very important that the Technology Team (DEV &amp; UI Lead) break down the steps and familiarize themselves with the nuances of the features to intelligently question the design and highlight possible issues before alterations become more impactful to the timelines. QA at this point can even scaffold out User Tests on features during this step.<br><br><br>Team review of the UX design of Project X. Highlight and Flag and Feasibility Changes and Iterate over them with the UX team. Team will submit a scaffolding of tickets to produce the Application. Details should include Data needs, Implementation Specifics, Analytics definitions, and Front-End Breakdown.<br><br><br>These steps are mostly dependent on the previous and could be collapsed to a single ticket but the ambiguity of the Data API it is best to keep these tickets into separate tickets to utilize a wider base of resources.<br><br><br>API &amp; Data Structures to support the application outline the data handshake and return results for App Build Team &amp; UI Team.<br><br>A user may only visit the URL if the user is logged in. The page will do all needed steps to redirect the user through log in in needed and redirect the user back to the page after success. Define URL &amp; create the hosting page in Sitecore.<br><br>A user should be able to visit a URL and have an application on that page respond to the visitor with the information it has available to it. Create the shell of the application and establish needed hooks to the data the application will know. This information is defined by the project but in the most basic definitions the application will know about the User, and possibly the URL and any query structures.<br><br>When the user visits the application, and it is loaded the application will initiate and collect information through API calls to store any data that is needed to display information and formulate any actions needed for the user defined by the project.<br><br><br>Components should follow the single tenant that they are only responsible for data passed to them and emitting their context. This separates concerns when the Application takes most of the features and components can stay agnostic.<br>When creating components all new components will be created with the library’s project folder. If the team finds value for a specific component that is generic enough to be reusable across many applications, the component can be promoted to a common library folder. Be aware that common components require a greater level of flexibility and scope to make them bullet proof for generic consumption.<br><br><br>Component tickets should encompass basic mutations that are needed for that component. Basic examples or mutations are Size, Location or Inclusion, Props (Data they will display), Validations, States, Etc. This should result in a Code Review and a Demo with UX Team and Product Owner. To reduce meeting overload, they can be grouped with other tickets or be deferred to the Feature Refinement Ticket<br><br><br>The user should be able to see the data they need to see and interact with data as defined by the requirements this is known as feature. In many cases features can be scaffolded with their data and methods without the need of utilizing components. Operations of an application like looping, reductions, additions, removals, data hooks and server responses can be all worked out without the use of components.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature. <br>For Example, “scaffold delete this line item from the list.” This will produce a data storage, list and methods and listeners that can be used to remove data from the list. This would also include any database API and deal with the response return updating the stored data of the list.<br><br><br>Inclusion of components and refinement of the frontend features. These phases will “wire” data and properties to components into the application. Depending on the size of the application these can be broken down into Features, or Pages, or States. This is the moment where components are due from the front-end teams. The deployment of components can be more staggered if the team is more comfortable with constant deployments. The benefits of this would be a lister would be available much earlier in the development process but may need to be updated or rewired if changes to validation or data needs alter in the refinement process.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature in the App<br>For Example, “A user by clicking on the delete button on a list item should delete it from the list.” Render a data list with the delete button. On the click add a listener to the application that will trigger the delete feature that has been scaffolded. QA this feature. Demo this Feature with UX Team and Product Owner.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\structure-and-content-guidance\spa\outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/SPA/Outline of Tickets for SPAs in Vue.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:25 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Product Pages]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>Assignee: Analytics Team<br>
Labels: Google Analytics, Usage Report, Web Traffic<br><br><br>We need the Analytics team to generate a snapshot Google Analytics usage report for all content within [Defined Project Scope] on ACC.org. The objective is to understand the current engagement and traffic patterns of the affected pages before content restructuring or updates. This report will help us make data-driven decisions about content prioritization and identify high-impact pages that need special attention.<br><br><br>
<br>
Target Pages:

<br>All pages and assets within [Defined Project Scope] (including Features folder).
<br>Any additional content types that might be relevant (videos, PDFs, downloads, etc.).


<br>
Report Requirements:

<br>Traffic Metrics (Last 12 Months)

<br>Pageviews
<br>Unique Pageviews
<br>Bounce Rate
<br>Average Time on Page
<br>Exit Rate
<br>Sessions with these pages


<br>Engagement Insights

<br>Top-performing pages within the scope (highest pageviews &amp; longest session duration).
<br>Pages with high bounce rates (indicating low engagement).
<br>Exit pages (where users leave ACC.org).
<br>Traffic sources (organic, referral, direct, paid, social).
<br>User demographics (geolocation, device type).


<br>Referral &amp; Linkage Data

<br>External referral sources driving traffic to these pages.
<br>Internal navigation patterns (where users go next).
<br>Pages linking into the scope vs. pages linked from the scope.


<br>Search Performance (If available from GA and Search Console)

<br>Top search queries driving users to these pages.
<br>Click-through rate (CTR) from search results.
<br>Average ranking position of the pages in Google Search.




<br><br><br>

<br>Consolidated summary of page performance.
<br>Breakdown of traffic sources, engagement, and user behavior.
<br>Insights into high-value and underperforming content.


<br>Referral &amp; Navigation Flow Report:

<br>Visualization of how users move to and from the pages in scope.
<br>Identification of critical traffic sources.


<br>Search Performance Report (if available):

<br>Keyword rankings and traffic trends for these pages.


<br><br><br>
<br>The Google Analytics Report is delivered and includes all requested metrics.
<br>Key insights are highlighted (e.g., high vs. low-performing pages).
<br>Referral and navigation data provide clarity on how users interact with these pages.
<br>If data is missing due to tracking limitations, a note explaining the reason is included.
<br><br><br>
<br>Access to Google Analytics and Google Search Console for ACC.org.
<br>Confirmation of the [Defined Project Scope] before pulling reports.
<br>Timeframe selection: If a standard period (e.g., last 12 months) is not appropriate, an alternative timeframe should be determined.
<br><br><br>
<br>If any pages lack tracking (e.g., missing GA tags), flag them for resolution.
<br>If applicable, consider segmenting reports by user type (e.g., members vs. non-members).
<br>If deeper analysis is needed, a follow-up request can be submitted based on the initial findings.

Acting semi-independently from the main site, it caters to a niche audience or user need that benefits from a narrowed scope and tailored options, away from the broader offerings of the main site.<br>The microsite adopts the fundamental branding guidelines of ACC.org while introducing its unique design, structure, and organization. This concentration of tailored information and user actions makes it an effective tool for engagement.<br><br>
<br>Focused Content: Microsites allow you to create content that is highly targeted towards a specific audience or topic. This can help improve user engagement and conversion rates for that specific topic or audience.
<br>Product Brand Alterations: Microsites provide an opportunity to apply branding and design strategies unique to the product.  
<br>Campaign-Specific Messaging: Microsites can be an effective tool for unique marketing campaigns or product launches, where a dedicated site can deliver a focused message.
<br>Fast Deployment: Microsites can typically be augmented and launched more quickly than adding substantial new sections to an existing site. Most often this work is bespoke and one off.
<br>Flexibility: Microsites can be easily tweaked or shut down without affecting the rest of the company's web presence.
<br>User Experience: Microsites can offer a more streamlined and targeted user experience, leading to improved customer satisfaction and conversion rates for a product.
<br>Improved Tracking: It may be easier to track the effectiveness of a specific campaign or audience through a microsite, as analytics can be specifically tailored for the site.  
<br>Independence: If different departments or branches of a company want to maintain a certain level of autonomy in their web presence, microsites can offer this independence.
<br><br>While microsites can be valuable tools, they also come with inherent challenges that can affect your digital strategy. These challenges underline the fact that while microsites can be effective for specific initiatives, they should be used judiciously and with clear purpose, given the potential costs involved.<br>
<br>Brand Consistency: Operating multiple microsites can disrupt brand uniformity and recognition, causing customer confusion.
<br>Increased Management Complexity: The operation and maintenance of various microsites amplify the complexity of website management, requiring additional resources. The bespoke nature of the code might also lead to problems during system upgrades.
<br>SEO Risks: Microsites could cannibalize the SEO value of the main site and end up competing with it in search results.
<br>

<br>User Navigation and Context Confusion: Due to their distinctive branding and self-contained nature, microsites can create navigation challenges for users. Moving between multiple microsites and the main site can lead to a disorienting user experience. This context-switching confusion is typically less prevalent in a single, unified site of the main site.


<br>Content Duplication: Managing content across the main sites and isolated microsites introduces the risk of duplication and subsequent issues with content upkeep, maintenance  and SEO.
<br>Traffic Dilution: Traffic is dispersed across multiple microsites instead of being directed to one central site, leading to a dilution of traffic on the main site and less cross-site discovery.
<br>Discoverability: If not directly linked or referenced from the main site, microsites may be more difficult for users to find.
<br>Sustainability: Maintaining and updating numerous microsites over time can prove challenging, potentially resulting in outdated information.

We should set high thresholds for what qualifies a topic or campaign for a separate microsite. Rather than creating a microsite, the default Generic Page approach should be utilized incorporated within the information architecture of our main site. Only when the content meets exceptionally stringent criteria—whether that's relevance, audience specificity, or uniqueness—should we consider the development of a standalone microsite.<br><br>
<br>
Specific Target Audience: Content needs to be tailored to a highly specific audience that can't be effectively targeted through the main site.

<br>
Unique Campaign: The content should pertain to a unique, typically time-bound campaign that requires distinct messaging separate from the broader brand or company offerings.    

<br>
SEO Strategy: The microsite should have a clear, separate SEO strategy focused on keywords and topics not covered by the main site.

<br>
User Experience: The microsite should offer a uniquely engaging user experience, such as an interactive product demo or immersive storytelling, that wouldn't fit well within the main site.

<br>
Unique Functional Requirements: The microsite should require functionality not supported or feasible on the main site, such as a unique user registration process, specific eCommerce setup, or API integrations.

<br><br>
<br>
New Product Launch: The content should relate to the launch of a new product or service that could benefit from focused attention and doesn't fit neatly into the existing site structure.

<br>
Event Promotion: The content should promote a specific event that warrants its own promotional and informational space.

<br>
Partnership or Collaboration: The microsite should be created for a joint venture, partnership, or collaboration with another entity, where separate branding and messaging is crucial.

<br>
Geographic Specificity: The microsite should cater to a specific geographic market that has unique needs separate from the main audience.

<br><br>
<br>Cost-Benefit Analysis: There should be a clear financial and strategic advantage to creating the microsite, with projected benefits outweighing the costs of development, maintenance, and potential dilution of brand or SEO.
<br>Defined Lifespan: Each microsite should have a defined lifespan, whether short-term or long-term. This timeframe should align with its strategic objectives, such as ongoing updates or serving as a reference resource. The expected lifespan should justify its creation and separate maintenance, ensuring it brings value during its entire existence.

<br>Current state on ACC.org-&nbsp; areas of the site that do not have navigation or links back to the rest of the site.

 <br>A microsite, also known as brochure pages, is an independent yet intergrated subsection within the main ACC.org framework. <br>Microsites must have an established goal to be considered to be broken away from the main Acc.org framework.<br>
<br>A clearly defined central focus and goal, the microsite serves as a concentrated platform for strategic communication and user interaction.
<br>This grouping of pages includes the basic branding of the main site while introducing: unique sub-branding elements, a sandboxed navigation structure. <br>
<br>These components establish a distinct identity, subtly differentiating the microsite while preserving coherence with the main brand. 
<br>The structuring of the microsite comprises multiple interconnected pages that form an exclusive navigation tree. This enclosed network ensures that each page links exclusively to other pages within the microsite, creating a tailored, immersive user journey. 
<br>TLDR Quick Read<br>
<br>Microsite: A distinct, yet cohesive, self-contained subsection within the ACC.org site.
<br>Sub Branding Elements: Unique branding features that distinguish the microsite from the main ACC.org brand, yet align with its basic branding.
<br>Enclosed Navigation Tree: The microsite encompasses a network of pages that interlink exclusively within its own scope, creating a customized navigation experience.
<br>Central Focus and Goal: The microsite is crafted with a specific objective, functioning as a dedicated communication and engagement platform.
<br>Aliases: The microsite is also known as Landing Page and Brochure Pages.

How is the functionality different from what is offered on the ACC.org site?

<br>
Where does it fit within the existing ACC.org site?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (It shouldn’t, but listing this would identify the gap.)

<br>Optional aspects :<br>
<br>Partnership or collaboration - is there a joint partner?

Each page is a chapter of the initiative's story, aimed to guide users to a strategically defined conversion point. Here's an outline of the elements:<br>
>>>>>>> 4db61ff (just checking in)
<br>Home of the Initiative: This main, full-screen page serves as the prologue to the initiative's story, providing a pathway back to the main ACC.org site. It features a text-free, richly layered hero image, a compelling call-to-action (CTA), and supportive information to propel the narrative. Additional CTAs invite visitors to explore further details.  

<br>Hero Image: This visually arresting image, free from text and easily adaptable to cropping or trimming, imbues the microsite with a unique "flair" or brand identity. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hero Image with CTA" data-href="Hero Image with CTA" href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\structure-and-content-guidance\microsites\components\hero-image-with-cta.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hero Image Requirement</a>
<br>Initiative CTA and Hero Image: The microsite distinguishes itself from the main ACC.org site through its unique branding, represented by the hero image and a clear, persuasive CTA. This combination piques user interest and encourages action.


<br>Sub-Pages and Micro Branding: Consistent branding is carried through to each sub-page via a smaller image that reflects the "flair" of the home page's hero image.

 <br>Full Page Splashes, orphan pages, or  marketing landing pages are isolated pages within our website's architecture that are not linked from the homepage and should be used sparingly and strategically. These pages exist outside of our website's primary navigation and can inadvertently disrupt a user's browsing experience. As a rule, these pages should only be created in specific scenarios - such as part of a well-defined marketing campaign with a predetermined lifespan.<br><br>Before implementing a Full Page Splash, ensure all of the following criteria are met:<br>
<br>The page is directly tied to a specific marketing campaign. <a href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a> 
<br>The page has a limited lifespan with a clearly established takedown date. <a href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a> 
<br>The page is structured within the Sitecore folder, specifically under Parent of Main Branch/features. <a href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a> 
<br>The content is succinct enough to fit on a single page without overwhelming the user. <a href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a>

<br>Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173258.png" src="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173258.png"><br><br>
<br>Personalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient.<br>

<br>Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product.<br>

<br>Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links.

<br>Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button.<br>



<br>Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173344.png" src="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173344.png"><br><br>
<br>Awareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly.<br>

<br>Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”.<br>

<br>Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement.<br>

<br>Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page.<br>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click.
  <img alt="Pasted image 20240924173411.png" src="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173411.png">
<br><br>
<br>Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment).<br>

<br><br>
<br>Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's "Join Now", "Sign Up", or "Purchase". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal.<br>

<br>Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience.<br>

<br>Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”).<br>

<br>Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email.<br>

<br>Track Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions.<br>

<br>Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency.<br>

<br>Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips).<br>

 <br>Backlog Ticket: Article "Children Renderings" Conversion to Arches<br>
<br>
Title: Convert Article Subtypes to Arches Format

<br>
Description:

<br>Background: Currently, the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes are not compatible with our ARCHES system. These subtypes include ClinicalTrial, GuidelineHub, JournalScan, PressRelease, Recommendation, TenPoints, and potentially others not listed.
<br>Objective: To successfully convert the "children renderings" of articles into the ARCHES format, ensuring seamless integration with the CMS and maintaining consistency across ACC platforms.
<br>User Story: As a developer, I want to convert the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes into the ARCHES format, so that articles can be more efficiently managed and displayed across ACC's digital platforms.


<br>
Acceptance Criteria:

<br>A working version of all article children types is established in a local environment.
<br>The conversion of all identified children renderings into the ARCHES format is completed.
<br>Ensure that the new ARCHES renderings are fully functional and compatible with existing CMS infrastructure.
<br>Maintain visual and functional consistency with the overall design and layout standards of ACC platforms.
<br>The conversion process and final output should be documented for future reference and maintenance.
<br>The conversion should be completed without causing any downtime or disruption to live services.


<br>
Dependencies: 

<br>The ticket depends on the successful setup of a local development environment for the joint development effort.
<br>This ticket blocks the work for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" target="_blank">APPSUPPORT-22095</a>.
<br>Coordination with the team members (Ling, Matt, Rowena, Jacob, and ASP Dev) for a 3-hour joint development meeting is crucial.


<br>
Notes for Joint Development Meeting:

<br>Confirm attendance and availability of all required team members.
<br>Ensure all necessary tools and resources are accessible during the meeting.
<br>Set clear objectives for the meeting to maximize productivity.
<br>Allocate time for discussion, development, and troubleshooting.

 <br>Editorial team makes use of a Show/Hide UI feature frequently. As part of the Arches conversion, the individual instances of this will be stripped.

`<br>

   function showHide(shID) {

Before I start this, I want to ask you to "love this for 5 minutes," then you can react.<br>In the act of working with clients, we often take the content documents we are offered, and our reaction to doing IA is to take that content and shoehorn it into UI to satisfy the client.<br><br>For years and possibly decades, I have taken content documents and shaved off a word or two. However, I have come to realize the immense detriment I have been doing to the strategic approach to content creation by skipping to the UI answer. Instead of merely using 'Styled UI' to reshape, mutate, and hide content, we should focus on enhancing the content to bolster the user experience by solving the underlying issues that users might face with the content that was initially delivered.<br><br>I have a different opinion on why we shouldn't create wireframes this early in a project. For the sake of speed, we, myself included, often skip the IA step, rushing to return to the client with wireframes. We then cleverly force their content into blocks and hidden areas on the page. The downside of internalizing the IA within the team and applying layouts and UI to content is that it directs our conversations with business lines toward solutions, rather than focusing on improving the content on the site. This undermines the value that IA discussions can bring. Jumping straight to UI wires limits our ability to challenge how we receive and refine raw content. We should at least help them transform it before we start applying UI.<br>I want to ensure there is a moment when clients are encouraged and guided to evaluate the provided content. Content strategists can have the greatest impact by unlocking the potential for more effective and engaging content.<br><br>Here is an example of what happens when we skip straight to UI. The wireframes react to the content as it is provided. In the team's review of overwhelming content, we responded by using accordions in the UI to hide excess information. This was a superficial fix that masked the issue—that the content was too lengthy and not concise. No changes were made to the content itself because we had already hidden it.<br>Now we have introduced a situation where our users are forced into a discovery mode, and we haven't solved the problem that the content was too much or not aligned with the actual goals of the page.<br><br>To maximize the effectiveness of content, we need to change our approach. Instead of rushing into UI design, we should follow a structured process:<br>
<br>Content Evaluation: Review the content before doing any design work. Understand the purpose of the content and whether it aligns with the project's goals.
<br>Information Architecture (IA) Application: Use IA to refine, organize, and simplify the content into a logical structure. Ensure that the content is easily navigable and user-friendly.
<br>Content Transformation: Apply appropriate hierarchies and organize the text logically. If necessary, split the content across multiple pages to make it more digestible.

<br>This should be a word document
<br>You can outline that content is either series on the page or is in parallel.
<br>Should denote page breaks and how it is wired between pages.


<br>Content Presentation: Share the revised content with the client. Encourage them to review it in a Word document format so they can engage with the material and provide feedback.
<br>Content Refinement: Based on client feedback, refine the content further. Make sure it is concise, clear, and aligned with the project’s objectives.
<br>UI Design: Only after finalizing the content should we begin designing the UI. At this stage, the content will be well-organized, aligned with user goals, and ready to be integrated into the page layout.
<br>By following these steps, we ensure that the content drives the design, not the other way around. This structured approach leads to better user experiences and more effective communication.<br>
<br>Where does this go?
<br>Should this be another page?
<br>What is this content saying?
<br>Should we hide this from the user?
<br>What is the point of this page?
<br>What are the goals, and does this content support them?
<br>Let’s encourage our clients to review the content in a Word document. It’s important for them to read through the information and share their thoughts. This step is crucial to ensure that the content matches the project’s goals and is easy for users to understand. As content strategists, we should lead this conversation by presenting our findings and showing our dedication to delivering top-quality content.<br>Only when we have finalized the content can we move on to page designs and work on the UI.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/thoughts/not-using-ui-but-word-documents.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Thoughts/Not Using UI but Word Documents.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:18:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Wendy.]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>The Hero Image on the homepage will now support an optional overlay button. This button will be configurable by content editors, allowing them to set the URL, text, style (primary or secondary), and position on the image based on different breakpoints (phone, small tablet, large tablet, and desktop).<br>Scope of the Feature:<br>
<br>If there is no URL and Label included in the configuration of the component the hero image area will not be clickable and the render will not render any button UI.
<br>It is MarComs responsibility to deliver an images in the correct size and dimensions with non critical information in the area where the button will be positioned.

<br>Sizes: 300x350, 600x300,900x300,1200x400
<br>Accepted images are PNG, JPG


<br>You can only choose 1 button position, style, URL, and label for all break points.
<br>The entire area of the Positioning grid will be clickable and cause the button to hover.
<br>The cards part of the feature will also will have their click box expanded to their entire area.
<br>Acceptance Criteria:<br>
<br>Button Configuration Options:

<br>URL: Editors can input the target URL for the button. This URL if empty and the Label is included should default to About-ACC URL
<br>Label: Editors can input the display text for the button.
<br>Style:

<br>Primary Button: Teal blue with white text.
<br>Secondary Button: Light grey with black text.
<br>ACC Brand Button: ACC Blue with white text
<br>ACC Brand Reversed: White with ACC Blue Text


<br>Position:

<br>Options: 'Left', 'Center', and 'Right'.
<br>Position varies depending on the breakpoint (refer to the "Button Position Based on Breakpoint" section below).




<br>Button Position Based on Breakpoint:

<br>Button Positioning Grid:

<br>the Grid inset is 0 0 60px 0 to the full width and eight of the image.
<br>1 rem padding from the edge of its inset image.
<br>The hit area of the image should be the entire area.


<br>Phone:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 4 (height)
<br>Button should size down one step from normal.
<br>Uploaded Size: 300w x 350h
<br>Grid Layout: 1 column x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Regardless of 'Left', 'Center', or 'Right' setting, the button will be centered in the bottom row.




<br>Small Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 2 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 600w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 2 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Large Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 900w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Desktop:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 1200w x 400h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell of the last row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.






<br>Responsive Behavior:

<br>The button's position and size should adjust dynamically based on the device's screen size and aspect ratio.
<br>The button should not overlap important text or imagery unless specified in the design guidelines.<br>
( this will be the responsibility of theMarCom to not place critical information in the art in the areas they selected for the button placement. )


<br>Editor Preview:

<br>Provide a preview in the CMS where editors can see how the button will look on different breakpoints before publishing.


<br>QA Testing Notes:<br>
<br>Test button configuration for all breakpoints.
<br>Validate button positioning aligns with the specified grid layouts.
<br>Verify that styling changes correctly based on editor selection.
<br>Test keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility.
<br>Design Reference:<br>

 <br>KSS, or Knyle Style Sheets, is a documentation syntax for CSS that allows developers to create a living style guide from CSS comments. It's structured to be both human-readable and machine-parsable, enabling automated tools to generate style guides from your CSS files. Here's an example of a comprehensive KSS comment block for a CSS stylesheet, including all the main options it can have:<br>/*
A button suitable for giving a user a call to action.

Style guide: Components.Buttons.Primary

:hover             - Highlights when hovered.
:disabled          - Dims the button when it cannot be interacted with.
.small             - A smaller button for less important actions.
.large             - A larger button for more important actions.

Markup:
&lt;button class="btn {{modifier_class}}"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;

Modifiers:
- .small - A small version of the primary button
- .large - A large version of the primary button

State classes:
- .is-active - Highlights the button as active
- .is-disabled - Shows the button as disabled

Variables:
- $btn-background-color: Color of the button background.
- $btn-text-color: Color of the button text.

$btn-background-color: #007bff;
$btn-text-color: #ffffff;

@brand Primary

@dependencies
- forms.css
- grid.css

@requires
- mixins.css
- variables.css

@implementations
- Web: components/button/button.css
- iOS: components/button/button.swift
- Android: components/button/button.xml
*/
.btn {
  background-color: $btn-background-color;
  color: $btn-text-color;
  /* other styles */
}
<br>This example includes:<br>
<br>Description and Title: A brief description of the component or style and optionally a title.
<br>Style Guide Reference: Indicates where in the style guide this component or style belongs.
<br>States and Modifiers: Describes different states (:hover, :disabled) and modifiers (.small, .large) that the element can have, including their descriptions.
<br>Markup: Provides an HTML snippet as an example of how to implement the described style.
<br>Variables: Lists any CSS variables (custom properties) used in the style, including their default values.
<br>Brand: Optional brand or category this component belongs to.
<br>Dependencies: Other CSS files or assets this component depends on.
<br>Requires: Additional resources or files that are required for this component.
<br>Implementations: Links or references to implementations of the component in different technologies or platforms.
<br>This structured comment allows developers and designers to understand the purpose, usage, and variations of a component at a glance. It can be processed by tools like KSS Node to generate a living style guide, ensuring documentation stays up-to-date with the code.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/jira/ai-prompts/knowledge-base/kss-documentation.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Jira/AI Prompts/knowledge base/KSS Documentation.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 13:12:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AI Prompt - SCRUM TICKET]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Frontend development continues to expand as a percentage of project coding to the point that some of our products, such as the clinical applications, are 100% frontend code. Over the past year, I have been putting work together to support a massive shift in how we do frontend and, in the long run, how we develop, support, and release our college software solutions.&nbsp;<br>The most significant issue I continually see in IT is decentralized coding efforts. Decentralization leads to repetitive solutions, inconsistent behaviors, extended regression testing, bloated packages, complicated deployments, and potential code errors as we try to make security patches or upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Focusing on improving how we execute frontend for the college and not just for a project, I have tackled four pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>Unification of design but building for flexibility
<br>Shifting to the CFD (component first development )
<br>Creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored
<br>Centralizing everything for everyone
<br>The unification of design was the first place I started. "Arches" is the current solution that enforces a Design Opps procedure to streamline requests and deliver a college-wide design system. This design system has two tenants. First, it can replicate its styles influenced by the brand and frameworks from its product space. It now covers QII, ACC, Cardiosmart, and Mobile and can be further scaled. Second is its utility framework that ensures a highly flexible practice to allow countless UI permutations without CSS mutations. Utility styling is also known as "scopeless" styling because you can build out many UI patterns without ever altering the original styles.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/" target="_blank">https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/</a><br>Shifting to CFD (component first development) embraces an architecture for our frontend products and alters how we develop. CFD, as a pattern, has been around since 2012 with bootstrap. In its infancy, CFD could only capture minor token UI. Still, with the introduction of javascript models like Web Components, React, Vue CFD can now capture business logic, complicated interface interactions, and data mutations. Vue has been my primary focus as it builds on the collective knowledge of the department. Vue has the capabilities to make obsolete Jquery UI, Pager, Knockout, Angular, JqueryMobile, and many other libraries that are currently in use. IT streamlining to a single dependency allows for universal software patching for frontend security issues.&nbsp;<br>Currently, we are creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored. As we shift to CFD, we can use Storybook which allows for documentation around a living singular component with artificial data. This type of documentation gives a single point of Design, Development, and QA. The effort on a single element can be attached to countless projects through version control. Centralized development and QA can give us a feasible path to automated unit testing and regression testing. As new projects come online, utilizing the global-version-controlled components would benefit from standards, consistency, and quality control. Preliminary work done with Storybook around a future product under the ACC.org "Home Page Redesign." Projects could include the transcript, CSTool, GL Search, Coveo Search, and FIT Management. <br>Vue 2 component for reference<br>

I have conversations  GM, Josh G, and Micheal M, and the great work of Ling C on creating a path forward with using assets.acc.org and also moving the newly used submodule features from GIT  within current and future products. Submodules empower the component work to be checked in and out from both the centralized-version-control and from projects, these efforts can be kept in sync. The vision for this project is to be controlled by ACC but utilizable by vendors.  ]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/front-end-design-at-the-college.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Front End Design at the College.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design System]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/design" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/design</a> <a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc</a> <a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/arches" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/arches</a> <a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a>

<br><br>
<br>
Development creates scripts to process changes provided by UI in Sprint B.&nbsp;

<br>Precondition: Components that need to be switched to Arches has already been developed, tested,&nbsp; and pushed to ALL environments (DEV, SPR, STG, RLS, PRD)&nbsp;


<br>
Run script in development environment for specific pages that apply to this batch (i.e., #1) and verify.&nbsp;

<br>
Review affected pages for discrepancies/bugs for resolution (e.g., code, components, etc.)&nbsp;

<br>If code changes are required, create JIRA tickets for upcoming sprint.&nbsp; Sprint C will be paused until these code changes are made in ALL environment&nbsp;


<br>
Review and identify any content issues (rich text, custom scripts) and work w/ BL on resolution&nbsp;



<br>
Run clean up script to identify problematic scripts that need to be&nbsp;remediated&nbsp;(<a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://support.acc.org/browse/AWC-3942" target="_blank">https://support.acc.org/browse/AWC-3942</a>) and push to environments accordingly.&nbsp;

<br>
Promote to other lower environments (SPR, STG, RLS) and validate in each environment accordingly.&nbsp;

<br>Perform demo for BL to review results of bulk conversion for batch in scope (STG or RLS) and obtain sign-off&nbsp;


<br>
Create a PRD back-up to support a rollback, if needed (requires further discussion around specific rollback tasks/steps)&nbsp;

<br>Take back-ups of both&nbsp;Author and Web DBs&nbsp;
<br>Need to enforce a&nbsp;content freeze&nbsp;(BL), specifically for a&nbsp;subset of pages/content&nbsp;


<br>
Promote to PRD and run bulk conversion script in Author ONLY, do NOT publish to Delivery.&nbsp;

<br>
IMPORTANT NOTE: To ensure content is NOT auto-published, there is a need to explore options.&nbsp;

<br>Option 1: Set content items to a DRAFT status when converting content in Author.&nbsp; See Sitecore DRAFT workflow doc&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Possible risk is the Original Posted Date may be updated as a result (need confirmation)&nbsp;
<br>Option 2: -- TBD&nbsp;


<br>
IT to perform spot checks in Author to ensure the conversion script was completed successfully.&nbsp;

<br>
BL reviews converted pages in Author and as pages are validated, publish in increments (as appropriate)&nbsp;

<br>UI, DEV, &amp; QA teams on standby to field any questions or address any concerns&nbsp;




<br>
Post Conversion/Clean Up Tasks&nbsp;(once all batches are complete, one-time task)&nbsp;

<br>Once conversion is complete, we will take the Arches presentations and merge them into the current legacy template presentation configurations, and delete the Arches versions, as clean up.&nbsp;


<br>QA Approach (DRAFT)&nbsp;<br>NOTE: This approach should be visited as we progress w/ the batches.&nbsp; Also, scheduled sprint content syncs should not adversely affect the Arches QA pages since they will already exist prior to the content sync.&nbsp;<br>
<br>UI/UX team will create an Arches QA dedicated page (e.g., page name to include '_ArchesQA' suffix&nbsp; in the DEV environment in support of their development &amp; verification process.&nbsp;
<br>Once the component updates have been verified in the DEV environment, UI/UX to request a Razl content sync to SPR in coordination w/ their updates getting built and deployed to SPR. (Ricky can assist w/ Razl syncs)&nbsp;
<br>QA will then use the Arches QA dedicated page in SPR to test the target components.&nbsp; Once validated in SPR, QA will work with DEV (Ricky) to sync content to upper environments (STG/RLS) as the changes are promoted.&nbsp;
<br>PRD deployment (e.g., pre-task) should include a step to sync the Arches QA dedicated page to PRD (Author ONLY, do not publish to Delivery) in order for QA validate in PRD.&nbsp;
<br>Once validated, need to ensure there is a clean-up process to remove/delete QA dedicated pages, once ready (in ALL environments)&nbsp;
<br>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It is important that we have a way to roll back our work at any point throughout these cycles and we need to be able to do this in a way that BL can be comfortable with. This plan doesn’t really account for if something goes pear shaped in Sprint C but we should probably iron that out as well, especially if something goes wrong during the push to production.&nbsp;<br>This looks like a three-sprint process, but we may be able to consider identifying the next batch during sprint C to speed up conversion if necessary.<br><a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:acc/arches" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/arches</a> <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:acc/arches/conversion" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/arches/conversion</a> <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:acc/guidance" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/guidance</a> <br>Metadata

 <br>The process of bulk conversion is a nuanced operation that significantly depends on the scope of the pages being converted. Each bulk conversion task is unique, and while insights and learnings from previous conversions inform the process, it's important to note that a bespoke report is produced after each conversion. This report, presented in an Excel document, is a crucial tool that outlines the User Interface (UI) items within the editorial scope - including Rich Text and Custom Scripts - that require remediation following the conversion. The items are neatly categorized by sheet, each containing the Item ID, URL, and proposed remediation notes. This systematic approach provides a comprehensive view of the areas within the CMS that may need review, adjustments, or those indicating a potential function failure. Typical remediation steps include actions like "let fail," "add classes," "remove," and "replace with components," but this list is not exhaustive. If more complex actions are needed, additional notes may be added for clarity. This meticulous process ensures an efficient and methodical approach to addressing changes and potential issues post-conversion.<br><br>A listing of all pages effected by the conversion<br><br><br>]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/editorial-bulk-change-notice-excel.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audit of Editorial UI]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Over time, the content areas of our CMS have seen the implementation of various User Interface (UI) solutions. Often grassroots in origin, these Editorially Created UI elements, composed of inline styles, in-page styles, and JavaScript, present considerable maintenance and update challenges.<br>To manage this tech debt, our bulk conversion process aims to remediate or remove these elements. The goal is to align our UI with the Arches Enterprise Design System, which entails eliminating non-conforming in-page JavaScript and Styles.<br>To facilitate this, we're conducting an audit of the Editorially Created UI components. This audit plays a crucial role in forming a plan that ensures website functionality while addressing unnecessary complexity.<br><br>This process involves a meticulous examination and subsequent remediation of all editorially integrated links - a prerequisite before launching any audit. Our audit also thoroughly reviews content areas embedded with script and style blocks. Particular attention is given to the returned content scrape, which is systematically converted into a Unicode format that's safe for coding.<br>As part of this procedure, we identify and replace certain patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their equivalent symbols, and transform specific HTML entity codes into spaces and carriage returns, thereby improving block readability. This method allows the team to evaluate readable blocks effectively and discover any "new" patterns, which aids in documenting necessary remediation steps. This systematic approach prepares us for the eventual removal of style and script blocks, creating the necessary tickets or steps as required.<br>Numbered Steps:<br>
<br>Begin by running the remediation of all editorially included links that are set to "Save" before initiating the audit.
<br>Perform an <a data-href="#Audit Report" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/about:blank#Audit_Report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Audit Report</a> of content areas that contain script and style blocks on the page.
<br>Ensure the returned content scrap is converted into a code-safe Unicode because of the <a data-href="#Content Scrape Limitations" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/about:blank#Content_Scrape_Limitations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Content Scrape Limitations</a>.
<br>Identify and replace specific patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their corresponding symbols.
<br>Substitute certain HTML entity codes into space and transform others into carriage returns.
<br>Evaluate the now readable blocks after the aforementioned transformations.
<br>Discover any new patterns that emerge from the evaluation, and document the appropriate <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Remediation" data-href="Remediation" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/remediation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">remediation steps</a>.
<br>Finally, create any necessary tickets or steps to prepare for the obliteration of style and script blocks.
<br><br><br><br>To make the code more readable, it's crucial to replace certain Unicode characters with their typical representations. Specifically, we'll be dealing with the following conversions:<br>
<br>The Unicode for the carriage return, _000D_, should be replaced with a visual marker for carriage returns such as the symbol "↵".
<br>The Unicode for the horizontal tab, _0009_, could be replaced with a few spaces for better visualization.
<br>The Unicode for the space, _0020_, can be substituted with a visible space character.
<br>The line feed character, represented by the Unicode _000A_, can be swapped with a new line symbol like "␤" to depict line breaks better.
<br>The tab character, also represented by _0009_, should be replaced with a few spaces for clarity.
<br>Finally, the Unicode for less than and greater than symbols, &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;, can be converted to their actual "&lt;" and "&gt;" symbols.
<br>By transforming these Unicode characters into their corresponding visual representations, we significantly enhance the comprehensibility of the document, thus facilitating easier identification of different elements and their spacing.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Audit of Editorial UI.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Script Process]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/arches/conversion" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/arches/conversion</a> <a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a>

<br>Change legacy components to Arches components using the master component mapping document as reference.
<br>Content Remediation (After sprint A audit of style and script blocks)<br>
<br>Remove the following from rich text and custom script content:

<br>External stylesheet links
<br>External JavaScript links
<br>Style blocks
<br>JavaScript blocks
<br>In-line styles
<br>In-line JavaScript calls


<br>Check converted pages (within reason) and adjust clean up script as needed if content gets mangled.
<br>Observations &amp; Notes:<br>Batch 1:<br>
<br>Debugged a content block that used an incorrectly spelled  tag. This broke the page post conversion and evaded the style blocks removal script. The clean up scripts will be adapted to this typo so future instances should be caught and removed but verify as needed.
<br>Verify the scripts run clean. Special characters, for example, may still cause the automation to stop or manipulate code incorrectly.

 <br>&nbsp;I want to outline a comprehensive Knowledge Transfer (KT) strategy that targets the required remediation steps. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition, allowing our team to manage the work systematically and avoid overwhelming our team resources and capabilities.&nbsp;<br>Here's a step-by-step process to guide our KT activities:<br>Sub-dividing the Conversion into Manageable Segments:&nbsp;We can accomplish tasks efficiently throughout the week by dividing the bulk conversion into themed work or manageable segments. For instance, focusing on a specific aspect like "all the pages that have tabs" will make the process more digestible and actionable.<br>Weekly Kick-off Meeting for Conversion Blocks:&nbsp;At the start of the week, we will convene a meeting where a conversion block of pages is presented. This meeting will include a live demo showing how to make the necessary changes, providing an excellent opportunity for team members to understand the process firsthand.<br>Standing 30-Minute Meetings throughout the Week:&nbsp;To ensure continuous support and clear communication, I suggest scheduling a standing 30-minute meeting every day. This stand-up meeting will be a forum to discuss any roadblocks or questions related to the assigned work. It will enable real-time problem-solving and maintain momentum in the project.<br>Here’s a high-level schedule to illustrate the flow:<br>Monday:&nbsp;Kick-off meeting with a conversion demo for the week's segment (e.g., pages with tabs).<br>Tuesday to Friday:&nbsp;Daily 30-minute stand-up sessions to address questions and roadblocks.<br>End of Week:&nbsp;Recap and assessment of the week's accomplishments, planning for the next segment.<br>By adhering to this process, we aim to create a structured approach to knowledge transfer, facilitating the handling complex conversion tasks and empowering our team with the confidence and competence needed.  <br>Also, it's worth mentioning that our KT process is designed to be flexible and responsive to the team's evolving needs. As our collective experience and proficiency grow, we anticipate that the demand and duration of the daily stand-up meetings may not be needed or shortened. We'll continually assess the progress and adjust accordingly, ensuring our approach remains efficient and aligned with the team's capabilities. Continued feedback will be instrumental in this ongoing refinement, keeping us agile and focused on our shared goals.  <br><br>ACC User Experience Team&nbsp;<br>American College of Cardiology<br>2400 N Street NW<br>Washington DC, 20037<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="render:///www.acc.org" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/render://www.acc.org" target="_blank">www.acc.org</a>]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/kt-sessions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Editorial training/KT SESSIONS.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[experience editor]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>Considering the difficulties that editors encounter in distinguishing between legacy, converted, and legacy supportive components, owing to the absence of folder structure and clear naming, we've introduced a streamlined approach. All component icons are now set to grey or red by default. However, converted and supportive components, along with the majority of new work, will be marked with either blue icons for compatible renderings or green for new arches components. This blue color is intended to be the default setting both arches and legacy supportive components. It's essential for the development team to review and ensure this default setting when releasing new work into the platform. In any instance where the blue green or grey is not the icon for the rending, the setting must be promptly corrected.<br>
Further Icon Definition allow for even easier recognition in the back end will be. Page Layout components should be Starts, Vue/JavaScript driven components should be puzzle pieces.  <br><br>When looking at the display view list in the backend you only see the render name and its relative location that it is placed in the list. As the teams move forward in using more and more shared content and breaking down content into chunks the Display view gets rather unuable becuase you would see RichText written possilbly 5 times on the page the same is true with accordions. In that view is it possible to interject at least the details of the source which can be altered with a nickname like intro-text, benifit grid.....<br><br>The component dependency tree outlines the interrelationships between components in a Sitecore instance, specifically identifying those that are either children of a component or have dependent child components. Only necessary components should be configured in this instance to maintain simplicity and reduce confusion for editors. This approach also minimizes the risk of including non-supportive components by lessening the need for editors to manually add components. Ultimately, this method aids in preventing the appearance of non-supportive components within converted pages, ensuring a clean and efficient working environment.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/components/quality-of-life-configurations-with-sitecore.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Components/Quality of life configurations with Sitecore.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 22:05:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating A New ACC.org Component]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Subject: Exciting Opportunity: Redesigning Member Sections<br>Dear Team,<br>As we embark on the transformative journey of redesigning our Member Sections, I want to share an overview of our strategic process and the essential tasks that will lead to our success. This initiative, commencing after the Annual Meeting in April 2025, involves over twenty sections and will require our collective effort to achieve outstanding consistency and quality.<br><br>Leading up to April 2025, Jackie, Laura, and I will concentrate on several key tasks to establish a solid foundation:<br>
<br>
Proof of Concept (POC):

<br>We will finalize a robust WIC POC to define our preferred tone, brevity, and structure. This benchmark will guide all pages and content styles.


<br>
Content Access Guidelines:

<br>After cleaning up existing content, Jackie and I will draft clear guidelines delineating public-facing content from that exclusive to members. We'll circulate this initial draft to the Tiger team for insights.


<br>
IT Development Planning:

<br>Armed with the POC, we will collaborate with leadership to outline and align on our anticipated IT development requirements for dynamic content and and the user onboarding logic.


<br>
Content and Resources Collection:

<br>Our team will create an effective initiation script and a user-friendly content collection form to streamline the content-gathering process for our liaisons.


<br>This groundwork will empower us to seamlessly engage with staff liaisons following the Annual Meeting.<br><br>Content collection for our Member Sections is scheduled to begin in April 2025. To optimize our resources, we will prioritize which sections to revamp first.<br>
<br>
Kickoff Meeting/Workshop:

<br>We will introduce the dedicated project team and the creative assets needed for content collection. 
<br>Matt and Jackie will lead a workshop to showcase an illustrative section while demonstrating the collection form.


<br>
Content Collection Responsibilities:

<br>Each section team will undertake the content collection and refactoring, utilizing the WIC POC as their guide. Our oversight will ensure alignment and quality throughout the process.


<br>
Completion of Content:

<br>Once content is gathered, our coordination team will collaborate with MarCom to generate essential images for prominent features.


<br>
Quality Assurance:

<br>A JIRA ticket will be created to document the creation of the newly refactored Member Section, ensuring transparency and tracking.


<br>
Editorial Review:

<br>Based on our priorities, the completed section will be processed, entered into Author, reviewed, and then published for production.


<br>
Repeat for All Sections:

<br>This process will be repeated systematically for all remaining sections.


<br><br>
<br>Early 2025: Finalize the POC, establish clear content guidelines, plan IT development, and prepare liaison resources.
<br>Post-Annual Meeting (April 2025): Launch engagement with liaisons and section teams to kick off content collection.
<br>If you have any questions or need further insights on this exciting project, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Together, we can create an exceptional experience for our members.<br>Looking forward to our collaboration,<br>
Matt &amp; Jackie]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\projects\member-sections\project-build-outline.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/Member Sections/Project Build Outline.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[User Journey Prompt]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Here are all four personas, incorporating the updated preferences:<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Emma Wright  

<br>
Demographics: 42, Cardiologist, Busy Practitioner  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
Emma frequently visits the member section but rarely interacts. She uses the platform to gain exposure to new ideas and practices outside the confines of her immediate professional environment. Though she doesn't contribute to discussions, she values the ability to access diverse perspectives and knowledge that she might not encounter in her day-to-day practice.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Access to a broader range of insights and innovations outside her specialized work environment  
<br>Exposure to emerging trends and interdisciplinary practices without the pressure to engage  
<br>Staying up-to-date on best practices in cardiovascular care across a wide professional spectrum


<br>
Frustrations:  

<br>Feels disconnected from the broader community, as she does not actively contribute  
<br>Finds the structure of the member section limiting in how it presents different perspectives

Opportunities for Engagement:

<br>Encouraging passive participation through features like recommended reading based on emerging trends  
<br>Exposure to discussions and webinars that broaden her view outside her regular practice area


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: David Chen  

<br>
Demographics: 34, Nurse Practitioner, Cardiovascular Specialty  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
David sees the member section as a much-needed space where he can connect with like-minded professionals who share his focus on cardiovascular care. In his current professional environment, he often feels isolated due to the niche nature of his specialty. The member section provides him with a sense of belonging, allowing him to engage in meaningful discussions, contribute his expertise, and exchange ideas with others who understand his field.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Building connections with professionals who share his specialty and interests  
<br>Participating in discussions and sharing his experiences to contribute to the collective knowledge of his "tribe"  
<br>Seeking out a supportive community that is not readily available in his current work environment


<br>
Frustrations:  

<br>Lacks opportunities for collaboration and shared experiences within his immediate workplace  
<br>Difficulty finding deeper engagement in discussions that go beyond surface-level topics


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Dedicated spaces or groups within the platform that focus specifically on his specialty, fostering a "tribe" mentality  
<br>Opportunities for collaboration on case studies or joint projects with other specialists  
<br>Recognition for contributing to niche discussions, further building a sense of community and validation


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Lisa Patel  

<br>
Demographics: 48, Physician Assistant, Balancing Multiple Roles  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
Lisa uses the member section to break free from the professional silos of her work. When she engages, she actively seeks out networking opportunities with peers from diverse backgrounds. These connections help her gain insights and ideas outside the boundaries of her current professional setting. Her engagement comes in bursts, focused primarily on meeting new people and exchanging knowledge.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Networking with professionals from various specialties to broaden her perspective  
<br>Engaging with peers to exchange innovative ideas and learn from different fields  
<br>Building relationships that provide exposure to new methods, outside of her regular clinical environment


<br>
Frustrations:  

<br>Difficulty maintaining new contacts and finding ongoing opportunities to interact  
<br>Feels her access to new ideas is limited during inactive periods, making her engagement feel sporadic and siloed


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Networking events or peer-matching features that introduce her to professionals from outside her usual circles  
<br>Opportunities to connect with members who share interdisciplinary expertise and experiences  
<br>Features to maintain relationships, such as saved connections or discussion prompts that encourage ongoing dialogue


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Dr. Marcus Johnson  

<br>
Demographics: 55, Senior Cardiologist, Thought Leader  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
Marcus is deeply invested in shaping the future of the member section. He not only contributes content but also actively influences how the site is structured and enriched. His vision is to create a space that fosters professional growth and collaboration. Marcus collaborates with the website's administrators, suggesting improvements and helping steer the development of new features that benefit all members.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Helping guide the direction of the section to better serve the community

<br>
Frustrations:  

<br>Limited ability to influence strategic decisions about the section’s development  
<br>Lacks advanced tools for proposing or implementing changes to the website structure and content curation


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Opportunities to join advisory boards or task forces that influence the site’s growth and development  
<br>Advanced content management tools that allow him to contribute strategically and enrich the member experience  
<br>Leadership roles in shaping and curating specific content areas or discussion threads

 <br><br>
<br>Intro
<br>How We Investigated the Problem

<br>Website Audits at Multiple Focused Levels: Content, Member Section Deep Dive, and UX Analysis

<br>Multi layered investigations have been done against this section of content




<br>Cutting the Fat &amp; Taking out the Trash

<br>Website Content Audit We have discovered obsolete pages and reduces the content and value that we need to cater to.

<br>Enforcing a new pattern for content production to reduce the repeat of this issue in the future. Doc Matter will take on some of content that once lived here. 
<br>The  content that is left in this zone will be more aggressively archived to reduce regaining bloat. 




<br>Dealing with the Customer Experience

<br>The Member Section Deep Dive has found the inconsistency has lead to a confused customer experience. Has lead to maintenance problems which as drained resources over the years stopping us from improving this facet of the Member Benefits to its fullest. Optimizing and simplifying can open up time and effort to really drive content and facilitation to return value back to the members.

<br>Structure Becomes the Same
<br>Content Channels become easier to follow
<br>Cross Usage and onboarding becomes simplified in messaging and action




<br>Reinforcing Value to Member Sections

<br>Member Section as a value exclusive access to tailored resources, mentorship, and leadership opportunities within specialized communities, helping professionals advance their careers, build credibility, and stay connected to the latest developments in their field.

<br>Access to Exclusive Content comes with putting the content behind a need to login. 

<br>This can open up future opportunities to enrich this content from conversations started in Doc Matter and through Workgroup Polish made into valuable resources and toolkits specific to these member sections


<br>Specialized Gated Digital Communities of Doc Matter established areas to start mentorship, and leadership opportunities
<br>Linking Globally Published Content builds Nontreaty and Visibility of the Section




<br>How does this work in the real world -

<br>Prototype Example.

<br>Static QR CODES a bust.

<br>Digital was slower because it is single threaded. Qrcodes could help but with randomize we don't have an option in place.  
<br>Type in responses (other)are less in digital vs print.  
<br>Digital was also slow because loading time.  

<br>Explore none internet connected option for survey
<br>Offline mode.  

<br>Survey monkey enterprise has an offline mode.  It has stored in an app.  




<br><br>
<br>We deploy multiple surveys from ACC should we review or at least be aware of them before conference.  
<br><br>
<br>Don’t go early on first day.   No one is hanging out till past keynote and later.
<br>Still can't engage older established clinicians.

 <br>Backlog Ticket: Article "Children Renderings" Conversion to Arches<br>
<br>
Title: Convert Article Subtypes to Arches Format

<br>
Description:

<br>Background: Currently, the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes are not compatible with our ARCHES system. These subtypes include ClinicalTrial, GuidelineHub, JournalScan, PressRelease, Recommendation, TenPoints, and potentially others not listed.
<br>Objective: To successfully convert the "children renderings" of articles into the ARCHES format, ensuring seamless integration with the CMS and maintaining consistency across ACC platforms.
<br>User Story: As a developer, I want to convert the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes into the ARCHES format, so that articles can be more efficiently managed and displayed across ACC's digital platforms.


<br>
Acceptance Criteria:

<br>A working version of all article children types is established in a local environment.
<br>The conversion of all identified children renderings into the ARCHES format is completed.
<br>Ensure that the new ARCHES renderings are fully functional and compatible with existing CMS infrastructure.
<br>Maintain visual and functional consistency with the overall design and layout standards of ACC platforms.
<br>The conversion process and final output should be documented for future reference and maintenance.
<br>The conversion should be completed without causing any downtime or disruption to live services.


<br>
Dependencies: 

<br>The ticket depends on the successful setup of a local development environment for the joint development effort.
<br>This ticket blocks the work for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" target="_blank">APPSUPPORT-22095</a>.
<br>Coordination with the team members (Ling, Matt, Rowena, Jacob, and ASP Dev) for a 3-hour joint development meeting is crucial.


<br>
Notes for Joint Development Meeting:

<br>Confirm attendance and availability of all required team members.
<br>Ensure all necessary tools and resources are accessible during the meeting.
<br>Set clear objectives for the meeting to maximize productivity.
<br>Allocate time for discussion, development, and troubleshooting.

 <br>Email Marketing<br>Here’s a streamlined process flow for utilizing Direct Marketing Emails, Social Posts, and Web Marketing to drive users to landing pages with single goal CTAs, optimizing for conversion:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240924173228.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173228.png"><br><br>
<br>Objective: Whether the goal is membership sign-up, promoting a specific product, or encouraging course enrollment, start with a clear and single-focused goal.<br>

<br>Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173258.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173258.png"><br><br>
<br>Personalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient.<br>

<br>Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product.<br>

<br>Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links.

<br>Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button.<br>



<br>Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173344.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173344.png"><br><br>
<br>Awareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly.<br>

<br>Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”.<br>

<br>Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement.<br>

<br>Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page.<br>

<br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click.
  <img alt="Pasted image 20240924173411.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173411.png">
<br><br>
<br>Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment).<br>

<br><br>
<br>Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's "Join Now", "Sign Up", or "Purchase". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal.<br>

<br>Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience.<br>

<br>Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”).<br>

<br>Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173440.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173440.png"><br><br>
<br>Track Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions.<br>

<br>Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency.<br>

<br>Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips).<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173458.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20240924173458.png"><br><br>
<br>
Direct Email:

<br>Send an email to non-members emphasizing the value of membership (e.g., “Unlock exclusive access to resources, discounts, and courses”).<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to membership sign-up landing page.<br>



<br>
Social Media Post:

<br>Post a testimonial or success story from a current member, emphasizing the benefits.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Learn More” → Redirect to landing page that further explains membership benefits.<br>



<br>
Website Banner Ad:

<br>Place a banner on relevant blog or content pages: “Become a Member Today and Get Access to Premium Courses”.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to landing page optimized for membership sign-ups.<br>

>>>>>>> 4db61ff (just checking in)
 <br><br>This is an audit of the two Product Pages that currently have overlapping content. Below is a numbered list of the two pages, and how they will be referred to thereafter:<br>
<br>Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S.:<br>
a. Referred to as CVTeam.
<br>Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S.:<br>
a. Referred to as Clinician-OUS.
<br>The two pages—"CVTEAM" and "Clinician-OUS"—contain significant overlap and some type-specific content. The recommendations below aim to streamline and unify both pages for clarity and ease of navigation for users. Content can be categorized into three groups: identical, very similar, and type-specific. The goal is to consolidate identical content, modify the similar content to fit both groups where applicable, and keep type-specific information targeted to the specific audience.<br><br>
<br>
Unify Duplicate Sections: Many sections across both pages have the same or nearly identical content, such as "How Will the Exam be Administered?", "What is the Reliability of This Exam?", and "What Topics Are Included on This Exam?". Consolidate these into one central resource (such as a FAQ) that is shared between both audiences.

<br>
Keep Persona-Specific Details Separate: Type-specific content should be kept separate where necessary to ensure that information remains relevant and directly applicable to each audience, e.g., "Who's Eligible to Take ACC's Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE)?" where eligibility criteria differ for NPs/PAs versus physicians.

<br>
Create Cross-References to Simplify Navigation: Provide hyperlinks between shared sections and persona-specific pages to make it easier for users to navigate between general and specific content. This will improve the overall user journey by reducing the likelihood of confusion between similar content.

<br><br><br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241030170446.png" src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20241030170446.png"><br>The proposed AI structure helps streamline the content by focusing each page's role to enhance user experience, reduce redundancy, and provide clear navigation pathways even when users arrive at the wrong page variant.<br>
<br>Product Page: Centralizes key exam-related content, making it the first point of reference for all users. It focuses on eligibility, application processes, exam administration, and a general overview, ensuring consistency and reducing noise by keeping shared content unified.
<br>Persona Detail Pages: Targeted at specific roles, these pages provide tailored details for eligibility, exam dates, preparation resources, and other specifics. By keeping type-specific information on dedicated pages, users can easily navigate to content relevant to their background without sifting through unrelated details.
<br>FAQ Page: Acts as a shared resource for questions that apply to both personas. This page will address common concerns, minimizing redundancy and providing a quick, centralized place for users to find general information. Hyperlinks will be used to direct users to persona-specific details where necessary.
<br>This structure is designed to help users who might have arrived at the wrong variant by guiding them to the right section, thus reducing user frustration and improving satisfaction.<br><br>Consolidation of Identical and Very Similar Content: Move sections that are largely duplicated to a shared FAQ or product page. These sections include "How Will the Exam be Administered?", "What is the Reliability of This Exam?", and "Does the CCKE Offer a Credential?" Doing so will help reduce maintenance efforts while also improving consistency for users.<br>
<br>
Maintaining Persona-Specific Content: For sections that are specific to either "Clinician-OUS" or "CVTeam," create separate Persona Detail Pages. For instance, eligibility requirements, submission details, and exam dates vary between the two audiences. Keeping these sections separate but cross-referencing shared content will reduce confusion while allowing both pages to provide specialized information.

<br>
Use of Accordion Components: Keep the collapsible accordion structure to allow users to access content in manageable portions, making the pages less overwhelming. Ensure that each accordion component has consistent headings and styles across both "CVTeam" and "Clinician-OUS" pages.

<br>
Navigation Enhancements: To further reduce confusion, provide clear links at the end of shared sections like "How Much Does This Exam Cost?" to direct users to persona-specific details.

<br><br>If the two products cannot be merged, it is recommended to rebrand one or both products to ensure they are distinguishable and reduce confusion. The proposed rebranding involves the following:<br>
<br>
Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S. (CVTeam): 

<br>Maintain existing branding, but emphasize that this version of the exam is specifically for U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants.


<br>
Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S. (Clinician-OUS):

<br>Rebrand this product to differentiate it more clearly from CVTeam. Consider adding a geographic or professional distinction to the name, such as "International Cardiovascular Knowledge Certification" or "Certified Cardiovascular Competence for International Physicians".


<br>
Visual and Structural Distinction:

<br>Introduce distinct color schemes or visual markers on both product pages to signal the difference at a glance.
<br>Update headers and footers to clearly mention the audience for each product, e.g., "For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S." vs. "For U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants".


<br>
Clarify Naming Across All Communications:

<br>Update all marketing, email, and support documentation to ensure that users are consistently seeing the rebranded names.
<br>Ensure that cross-references between the products are explicit about the intended audience to avoid any ambiguity.


<br>The goal of the rebranding effort is to reduce confusion, particularly among members who may be unsure which certification is appropriate for their professional background. By creating a stronger distinction between the two certifications, ACC can improve user satisfaction and reduce the potential for misapplication.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\projects\ccke\ccke-content-proposal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/CCKE/CCKE Content Proposal.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:12 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20241030170446.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\lib\media\pasted-image-20241030170446.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Content Change Proposal]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>The file includes all the necessary assets to create guideline algorithms, ensuring consistency across all designs. To maintain the established design system, use the provided color swatches, Illustrator panels, and graphic, character, and paragraph styles.<br>These design enforcements support a consistent experience and are reader-focused, making the algorithms easy to read, understand, and provide valuable information like the CORs (Class of Recommendation). The algorithm is mostly monochromatic, with a focus on high contrast separation between the background and text to improve readability. COR colors are used specifically to highlight important information, ensuring that critical details stand out for the reader.<br><br>
<br>Node and Decision Symbols: Always use the predefined symbols for nodes and decisions. These symbols are already designed to align with the correct COR color and shape, ensuring that each element is visually consistent and recognizable.<br>

<br>Line and Label Symbols: Use the predefined line and label symbols to maintain consistent visual direction and clarity. Lines such as "YES," "NO," and the avoid markers are standardized for effective communication.<br>

<br>Node Binders: Use symbols like NODE BINDER -- AND, NODE BINDER -- OR, and NODE BINDER -- ANY to represent logical connections between nodes clearly. This ensures that all decision junctions are presented in a consistent manner.<br>

<br>Line Styles: Lines connecting nodes are styled consistently with arrows indicating the direction of flow. There are no variations in line thickness.<br>

<br>Text Alignment: Text within each node should be aligned to the left and vertically centered to enhance readability.<br>

<br>Legend Placement: Place the legend in the top right corner by default. If there is insufficient space, use the bottom right, followed by the bottom left. Legends should never be placed in the top left.<br>

<br>Refer to the finished example to understand how these elements work together to create a consistent and branded algorithm design.<br><br>The Illustrator file is set up with an artboard named "Toolkit," which contains all the essential elements for designing guideline algorithms. This toolkit includes:<br>
<br>Symbols: Predefined symbols such as data nodes, decision shapes, and other graphic elements.<br>

<br>Graphic Styles: Graphic Styles are used for line styles and arrows, applying the consistent look and feel to lines and arrows based on a simple line in Illustrator.<br>

<br>Character Styles: The character styles in the file include options for titles, labels, node content, and more. Use the Title style for main headings, Zone Label for section labels, and Node Regular or Node Strong for content within nodes. There are also specific styles for COR Labels to ensure that Class of Recommendation values stand out appropriately.<br>

<br>Paragraph Styles: Utilize the Paragraph Styles to maintain consistency across body text and labels. For instance, use Node Text for text within nodes and Footnotes for any additional information provided at the bottom of the algorithm. The Line Labels style ensures all directional labels (e.g., "YES," "NO") are clearly formatted.<br>

<br>Color Swatches: The approved color palette for decision points and node types.<br>

<br>Toolkit Artboard: Refer to the toolkit artboard to quickly access and apply these elements.<br>

<br><br>
<br>Use the Toolkit: Start by using the elements provided in the toolkit artboard to maintain consistency.<br>

<br>Smart Alignment: Use smart guides to align elements properly, ensuring nodes align in the same column for a clean and professional layout.<br>

<br>Apply Character and Paragraph Styles: Always use the predefined character and paragraph styles to ensure that text formatting is consistent. This includes titles, labels, footnotes, and node content. Consistent use of styles helps maintain a reader-friendly experience and aligns with branding standards.

<br>Link outward sparingly.


<br>When to Use: For maintenance-friendly foundational content.    
<br>Avoid: Don’t force these into deep journeys—keep simple.<br>

<br><br><br><br>Pages that surface grouped or filterable content based on shared logic (e.g., date, topic, type).<br>
<br>Use Case: Article archives, event calendars, directory listings.    
<br>Why Used: Enables users to explore at their own pace.    
<br>Branding &amp; UI Elements: Search/filter controls, cards or table view, consistent previews.  
<br>Role in IA:    

<br>Serve as content aggregators.
<br>Often feed from CMS or tag-based logic.


<br>Rules &amp; Recommendations:    

<br>Label clearly and design for repeat use.
<br>Allow exploration but keep structure rigid.


<br>When to Use: For large, growing sets of content.    
<br>Avoid: Avoid making them content endpoints—always lead to something richer.
<br><br><br><br><br>Home Page → Concept Anchors → Initiatives/Product Groupings → Product Destinations or Standard Pages
<br><br>Home Page → Product Groupings → Product Destinations → Conversion actions (e.g., purchase)
<br><br>Home Page or Concept Anchors → Listing Pages → Standard Pages or Product Destinations
<br><br><br>
<br>Always connect broader, conceptual content (Concept Anchors) to detailed or goal-oriented content (Initiatives, Products, Listings).
<br>Clearly define user goals on transactional pages; remove or minimize unrelated content.
<br>Maintain consistent user expectations through predictable page structures and clear navigational relationships.

Score: 34 – Good; Minor Tweaks Only<br>
Breakdown:<br><br>Estimated Visitors:<br>
Approximately 400,000–500,000 monthly (based on SimilarWeb and verified public sources)<br>Estimated Membership Numbers:<br>
Approximately 35 million volunteers and supporters<br><br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
Professional Heart Daily (PHD) operates as a distinct subdomain focusing on professional education, guidelines, and resources. While it links to AHA journals, the integration is moderate, with separate navigation and branding. Content overlap exists in the form of shared guidelines and statements, but PHD primarily serves as a hub for professional development and networking.<br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
PHD offers a tiered membership structure, providing varying levels of access to educational resources, discounts, and professional recognition. The onboarding process is straightforward, with clear information on membership benefits and application procedures. However, some advanced resources require premium membership, indicating partial content locking.<br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
The site maintains a professional and inclusive tone, catering to a wide range of healthcare professionals. The language is formal yet accessible, aiming to engage both seasoned practitioners and those new to the field. While the tone is informative, it could benefit from more personalized narratives to enhance engagement.<br><br><br>Scores:<br>

<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/4)
<br>Education: ★★★★☆ (4/5)
<br>Advocacy: ★☆☆☆☆ (1/5)<br>

<br>Explanation:<br>
PHD excels in providing educational resources and facilitating professional development through events and publications. It offers substantial practice support tools  within the site and fosters networking opportunities within its communities at the events.  The emphasis remains on professional audiences with in this domain. Philanthropic initiatives are present but not prominently featured mostly on their main site.<br><br>Summary:<br>
Professional Heart Daily serves as a comprehensive resource for cardiovascular professionals, offering a wealth of educational materials, guidelines, and networking opportunities. Its structured layout and clear calls to action enhance usability, while its focus on professional development aligns with the needs of its target audience. Minor enhancements in personalization and expanded patient-focused content could further broaden its appeal.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/★-aha-professional-american-heart-membership-site.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/★ AHA Professional - American Heart Membership Site.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 16 May 2025 20:54:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMA -- American Medical Association]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Score: 36 – Good; Minor Tweaks Only<br>Breakdown:<br><br>Summary: The AMA's website exhibits a professional tone with clear calls to action and well-structured content. While the vocabulary is generally accessible, occasional medical jargon could be further simplified or defined to enhance understanding for a broader audience.​<br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 847,000 site users, with over 952,000 site visits reported in a recent period. ​<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/ama-advocacy-efforts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/ama-advocacy-efforts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a><br>Estimated Membership Numbers: As of December 2023, the AMA reported 282,952 members, including physicians and medical students.<br><br><br><br>Rationale: The AMA's main site (ama-assn.org) and the JAMA Network (jamanetwork.com) operate on separate domains with distinct branding and navigation structures. Minimal links between the two—such as the AMA site directing users to the JAMA Network for publications—the user experience is disjointed. Users must navigate between different interfaces, and there is no unified account system or integrated search functionality across both platforms. This separation indicates a loosely connected integration of experience.​<br>
<br>No logo Sharing
<br>No Design Sharing
<br>Barely Spells out JAMA
<br>Science Only
<br><br>Rationale: The content between the AMA main site and the JAMA Network is largely distinct. The AMA site focuses on advocacy, medical education, and professional resources, while the JAMA Network is dedicated to publishing peer-reviewed medical research. Although both platforms serve medical professionals and are under the AMA umbrella, their content offerings do not significantly overlap, indicating a low content overlap.​<br>
<br>Links to the Journal
<br>But Content is More business and "Policy" oriented and all "Science" is reserved for the Journal Site and it is true vice versa.
<br><br>Rationale: The AMA offers certain resources, such as CME options and articles, to non-members, but full access to benefits like the JAMA Network and specific discounts requires membership. The onboarding process is streamlined, with clear pathways for different user groups (e.g., physicians, residents, students) to understand and access membership benefits.​<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ama-assn.org/amaone/membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/amaone/membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a><br>
<br>Awesome benefit for Car Discounts :-)
<br><br>Rationale: The AMA's content is tailored to a wide range of medical professionals, including students, residents, and practicing physicians, indicating a broadly inclusive approach. The tone remains professional yet approachable, aiming to engage users effectively without excessive formality.​<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3153537/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3153537/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">PMC</a><br><br><br><br>
<br>Membership &amp; Networking Opportunities: ★★★★☆
<br>Donations &amp; Philanthropy: ★☆☆☆☆
<br>Events: ★★★★☆
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science: ★★★☆☆
<br>Practice Support Resources: ★★★★★
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: ★☆☆☆☆
<br>Education: ★★★★☆<br>

<br>Rationale:<br>
<br>Member Networking Opportunities: The AMA provides upfront member engagement and ask but unable to determine if there is a  platforms for members to connect, but there is room for enhancing interactive networking features.
<br>Donations &amp; Philanthropy: While the AMA engages in philanthropic activities the pages are buried on  the main site.
<br>Events: The organization annual meetings is located on the homepage but the other events that indicating a strong commitment to member engagement through events is hidden with in the long search bar. It is possible that behind membership walls this become more prominent or easier to find.
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science: With access to the JAMA Network and other publications, the AMA offers substantial scientific resources, but on the main site it is reserved to news elements about public health, practice, advocacy and the practice reserving the latest science to live only on Jama.
<br>Practice Support Resources: Resources are available articles are written to support medical practice management and an entire segment craft to multiple facets of practice support.
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: The site primarily targets medical professionals, with limited content directly aimed at patients. this type of content is practically no where on the site.
<br>Education: Educational resources, including CME opportunities and the AMA Ed Hub, are robust and well-integrated into the site.
<br><br><br><br>AMA clearly has a design system library in place. The collection of UI pattern feels pretty high so there is a certain about of consistency degradation not because they aren't following the rules but because they have too many to really show a visual pattern. They have an extensive  collection of patterns makes the site feel a little clumsy and overwhelming high usage of images that hold content and text utilizing font treatments that are not matching.<br><br>They collapse away their main NAV into a burger menu even on desktop when you are not on the homepage this is an interesting choice. I find it slightly frustrating because I am trying to move around the site as much. Maybe it isn't as much of an issue when users are being directed by Google and cross discovery isn't as important. It does reduce the overall visual noise which is pretty high on their site.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/ama-american-medical-association.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/AMA -- American Medical Association.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 17:34:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[fACS -- American College of Surgeons]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Assessment Categories:&nbsp;<br><br><br>Yes all but one have separate sites and the effort it must take to hold ECSD together seems like an un wise effort.  Most sites have some overlap but mostly the content is treated separately where most sites focus on the Association, Policy, and News where the Journal focus on the science. The division of science content varies where ACC is the worst offender of repeating and pointing to the journal and Neural is the Cleanest break.<br>AMA has an blended approach with a heavy focus on videography news that seems to blur the line but is still more editoral vs science in the end and not cloning like the acc.<br><br> This is also a blended approach but half fall into a singular link that drives them to the site and no way back from the journal. Others have publication pages that do more or less effort on "teasing" the publication only to teasing the current content in the publication at the same time.  Only the ACC has this content interspersed throughout the site and most are a focus section or a page on the site only.<br><br>All of the associations present events on either their home page or on a dedicated area off of the main nav. Things to note:<br>
<br>ESC takes over their homepage during their big conference
<br>HSR does third party events to make their calendar seem more full.<br>
On how they are supported it is honestly hard to tell some have teasers on the site and then drive to a shopping registration portal.
<br><br>Most of the organization layout the membership onboarding pretty well on their site up front and center.  Only AHA has a differnt sub-site for membership because of their business model.  All of the sites are much more upfront to the Member login vs just a site login and there are hints of more content beyond but it is honestly hard to tell. <br><br>Depends on the org some don't have any like ESC, and HRS, and then the king of it is AHA.<br><br>Impossible to tell if there is any it is beyond the wall and the don't really market it.<br><br>Most don't really it is pretty limited and is reserved to be on the Journal Sites. AMA is the greatest exception to this rule because they have a distinct focus and even a site for Video Editorial and Science Review that is outside of the focus of JAMA.<br>Feeds of articles on all sites are simpler then what ACC presents we are much more verbose on meta data and just content around article teasers on the stie.<br><br><br>Most of the Walling is either Transactional which is more aggressive to almost all of the orgs where purchasing is only possible for members or whole sections to review the materials for sale are beyond a pay wall. <br>Or the walling was Membership value focused AMA holds most of the video articles beyond a membership wall. <br>All other walling is focused primarily in the journal sites and no Main site element had a Teaser content approach it was either upfront this was  a member area or there was a login directly from an article teaser.<br><br><br>  Teased on the main page most go to a dedicated area, platform for the education some only do Member only purchases and bigger Associations like ESC do pricing.  <br><br>All of them have sister sites Ama the most disjointed ESC and AHA most harmonious in the brand.<br><br>AHA leads the pack on this one but most don't really put a lot of focus on patients except FACS.   FACS has a wing of its site for patients.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\projects\acc-redesign\discovery\metric-responses-to-word-doc.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Metric Responses to Word Doc.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:28:34 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Y-Axis Tone &amp; Expression]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>-4: Dull and Clinical<br>
Institutional, cold, and impersonal. Dense language and passive voice dominate. Little to no attempt at emotional connection.<br>

<br>-3: Rigid and Impersonal<br>
Very formal tone. Prioritizes technical correctness, often using third-person and jargon. Reads like an internal report or compliance document.<br>
>>>>>>> 4db61ff (just checking in)

<br>-2: Dry and Technical<br>
Clear but lacks warmth. Information is accurate, but tone is mechanical. Reads like textbook excerpts or white papers.<br>

<br>-1: Flat with Occasional Warmth<br>
Generally neutral and dry, but with sparse attempts at human connection—occasional conversational phrases or friendly headings.<br>

<br>0: Neutral Professional<br>
Balanced and clear, with minimal expression. Language is functional and accessible but doesn’t actively engage or emote.<br>

<<<<<<< HEAD
<br>Explanation:<br>
HRS places major emphasis on events (especially Heart Rhythm Annual Meeting), education, and scientific updates. Networking exists but is not hyper-prominent.

A journal section that outlines the journal product lives on the main site but the Journal is outside HFSA domain and lacks any visual or navigational unity with the main site. There are plenty of content that is derivative of the journal on the main site but most full-content links redirect users away from HFSA.org.

<br>Explanation:  <br>
<br>Membership &amp; Networking Opportunities: Easy to find, the pitch for becoming a member is cross medium with some on the web referencing pdfs with a great(but with too many stock photos) introduction video. Enhance Your Heart Failure Career with HFSA Membership <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/LOh75iLOEHs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/LOh75iLOEHs</a> 
<br>Donations: Mostly missing from the site there is some reference to becoming a sponsor from a corporate level but their finances seem to come from other streams of revenue.
<br>Events: There are events sponsored from the HFS with an ongoing calendar with a co-mingle of external events showing a delegation technique that makes their events seem more robust then what they can personally produce.
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science:. The main site does have some medical news but mostly in the view point of Industry.  All other science is point away to their disconnected journal.
<br>Practice Support Resources:  This seems to be their most lacking area of the site. Most practice support is more in the tone of Patient collaboration tools and practically nothing around the business.
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content:  A full suite of content: Events, Webinars, and articles.
<br>Education: Though education is clearly a focus for this organization is a supportive mechanism for them and is not segmented out so it is dispersed under membership, professional development, and patients.
<br>Advocacy:  Clearly important as a benefit and why users want to be a part of this org.
<br><br><br>
<br>SPONSORSHIP INTEGRATIONS: Donations come from Sponsorship and this reflects in other spaces like events, and education.  The small organization utilizes these 3rd Party production sources to enrich their calendar and educational spaces making those areas much more robust then what they could produce on their own. 
<br>Derivatives are page items on the main site vs the journal area.

Score: 35 – Good; Minor Tweaks Only<br>Breakdown:<br><br>Summary:<br>
ESC’s website is structured cleanly for professional and academic users. The reading level suits clinicians and researchers, with technical vocabulary prevalent throughout. Some jargon appears without consistent definition, especially in professional news articles. Sentence structures are a bit formal and often lean passive, though the layout and design promote good scan-ability. CTAs could be stronger to drive user action more clearly.<br><br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 1.2 million monthly visitors, according to Similarweb.​<br>
Estimated Membership Numbers: Over 105,000 healthcare professionals worldwide.<br><br>Integration of Experience:  <br>Explanation: Since the journal content is fully integrated within the main escardio.org domain with consistent branding and top-level navigation access, the user experience is relatively unified. Although some journal content may still open in external viewer windows, the structural integration supports a more cohesive experience.<br>Content Overlap:<br>
Explanation: The journals and the main site both target healthcare professionals, and while their formats differ (news/guidelines vs. academic papers), their thematic overlap is clear. Users encounter both journal links and practice guidance fluidly in the same experience, without unnecessary duplication.<br><br>Content Locking:<br>
Explanation: Access to certain resources, such as full guidelines and educational materials, requires membership or payment, indicating partial content locking.​<br>Onboarding:<br>
Explanation: The ESC provides clear pathways for professionals to join, with detailed information on membership benefits, suggesting a well-structured onboarding process.​<br><br>Audience Focus:<br>
Explanation: The ESC primarily targets healthcare professionals, with limited resources for the general public, indicating a somewhat inclusive audience focus.​<br>Tone &amp; Expression:<br>
Explanation: The tone across ESC's platforms is professional yet accessible, aiming to engage healthcare professionals without compromising on scientific integrity.​<br><br><br>Radar Chart Scores:<br>
<br>Membership &amp; Networking Opportunities: ★★★★☆  
<br>Donations &amp; Philanthropy: ☆☆☆☆☆  
<br>Events: ★★★★★  
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science: ★★★★★  
<br>Practice Support Resources: ☆☆☆☆☆  
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: ☆☆☆☆☆  
<br>Education: ★★★★☆  
<br>Advocacy: ★☆☆☆☆  
<br>Rationale:<br>
<br>Member Networking Opportunities: The ESC offers networking through its associations, working groups, and events, providing ample opportunities for professional connections.​
<br>Donations &amp; Philanthropy: While the ESC is a nonprofit organization, there is limited reference public fundraising or philanthropic campaigns on the main site.​ I can't find any significant mention on if you can donate and the current google reference to a donation page 404's
<br>Events: The ESC hosts numerous events, including the prominent ESC Congress, catering to healthcare professionals globally, but most of its Event content is co-mingled and content-centric with the news on ESC 365.​
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science: With a suite of high-impact journals and regular updates, the ESC continually published a well connected campaign around cardiovascular research.​
<br>Practice Support Resources: Provides guidelines and tools for healthcare, but practically missing any materials around practice support I would expect that is partially because the audience is the EU and that level of information would be shaped by the country level and would be to complex to outline at this organizations level.
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: The primary focus remains on healthcare professionals, and  barely any educational materials for patients, and I am not sure if I found any for a patient that was looking for any basic information.
<br>Education: Delivers a range of educational programs and certifications, such as online courses and webinars, for healthcare professionals, but mostly pushing off to it E-learn site to house the marketing..

<br>-4: Off-Site or Hidden<br>
There is no visible path to membership from the main site. Membership is handled on a separate domain, microsite, or poorly connected property. The process feels buried or unrelated.<br>

<br>-2: Minimally Present<br>
Membership exists but is not emphasized. A small “Join” link may be present, but there is little information about benefits, processes, or why someone should join.<br>

<br>0: Neutral Presence<br>
The site includes a membership section or page, but it’s not highlighted in the primary user journey. Information is available but not persuasive or well integrated.<br>

<br>+2: Guided Invitation<br>
Membership is clearly positioned as a part of the organization’s purpose. There's a clear, accessible call to action, with content describing the benefits and process, even if modest in presentation.<br>

<br>+4: Fully Welcoming<br>
The site uses engaging language and visuals to invite membership. The value proposition is clear, and onboarding is embedded into the experience—through guided flows, testimonials, benefit breakdowns, and visible CTAs across the site.

<br>-4: Fully Duplicated<br>
The main site republishes journal content directly, with minimal or no modification. Articles appear verbatim or are routinely mirrored. 
<br>-3: Derivative Duplication<br>
The main site frequently features adapted or summarized versions of journal articles. There’s heavy content recycling in different formats (e.g., blog posts, highlights, infographics).
<br>-2: Featured Cross-Publication<br>
Journal content is regularly spotlighted on the main site through excerpts, featured articles, or summaries. There’s a clear editorial flow from journal to main.
<br>-1: Light Journal Echoing<br>
Occasional journal content appears on the main site—select articles or issues are highlighted in news sections or as updates.
<br>0: Reference Integration<br>
The main site discusses the journal broadly, possibly with multiple references or deep links, but does not reuse actual content.
<br>+1: Deep Link Framing<br>
The main site promotes its journal through deep links to individual issues or articles, but without embedding or echoing the content itself.
<br>+2: Journal Link Presence<br>
The main site acknowledges the journal’s existence and links to it (usually at a high level like “Our Journal”), but without further editorial emphasis or content reuse.
<br>+3: Minimal Journal Exposure<br>
Journal presence is limited to a basic link or navigation tab. The main site content remains separate and self-contained.
<br>+4: Fully Distinct<br>
There is no shared content between the main site and journal. The journal is neither referenced nor discoverable through content pathways. Each site has its own editorial ecosystem.

<br>-4: Fully Locked<br>
Nearly all content is inaccessible without logging in or becoming a member. The public view offers only basic information (e.g., About page or login screen). 
<br>-3: Highly Restricted<br>
Most core content—such as articles, resources, tools, and even some navigation—is locked behind a member wall or requires login. Public access is very limited.
<br>-2: Partially Locked<br>
Many areas of the site (e.g., entire article categories, tools, or educational resources) require a member login. Public visitors encounter frequent access walls.
<br>-1: Targeted Restrictions<br>
Specific high-value content types (e.g., publications, event registrations, or toolkits) are gated for members, but general site content is open.
<br>0: Neutral Locking<br>
A mix of open and gated content, with some clear benefits reserved for members but without pervasive access control across the site.
<br>+1: Light Gating<br>
Most content is accessible without login, but membership offers enhanced experiences (e.g., downloads, personal dashboards, advanced tools).
<br>+2: Minimal Locking<br>
Only select areas, like purchasable products, exclusive webinars, or certifications, require member login. General content is open and searchable.
<br>+3: Open with Optional Login<br>
The site operates fully in public view. Login is only needed for personalization or e-commerce transactions, not for accessing substantive content.
<br>+4: Fully Open<br>
No clear locking mechanism is visible. All content appears available to the public, with little to no incentive or requirement to become a member for access.

<br>-4: Hyper-Specialized Professionals<br>
Content is designed for a narrow expert audience within a medical subspecialty (e.g., electrophysiologists, heart failure specialists). Assumes advanced, specialized knowledge.
<br>-3: Specialized Professionals<br>
Targets a specific field of professionals (e.g., general cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons). Language and tools are tailored for those practicing in that domain.
<br>-2: Field-Specific Professionals<br>
Appeals to the full range of professionals within a medical field (e.g., all roles within cardiology including clinicians, researchers, and educators). Still assumes a shared base of field-specific knowledge.
<br>-1: Broader Healthcare Professionals<br>
Engages professionals outside the core field, such as nurses, physician assistants, technicians, and allied health staff working in related areas (e.g., cardiovascular support teams).
<br>0: Clear Professional–Public Split<br>
The site separates content for professionals and the public, often with dedicated pathways (e.g., "For Clinicians" vs. "For Patients").
<br>+1: Informed or Affected Public<br>
Accessible to patients, caregivers, or individuals affected by health issues (e.g., heart disease), though professional content remains distinct and primary.
<br>+2: Educated Public<br>
Reaches out to general audiences interested in health topics, such as students, advocates, or fitness professionals. Medical language is simplified where needed.
<br>+3: Public-Oriented<br>
Content is framed for lay audiences with little or no medical background. Emphasis is on education, awareness, and broad understanding.
<br>+4: Fully Inclusive<br>
Designed to be understood by the general public regardless of background, with clear, jargon-free messaging and wide community appeal.

<br>-4: Fully Disconnected<br>
The journal and main site feel entirely unrelated. There is no shared branding, platform, or navigation. A user would not be able to tell the journal is part of the same association.
<br>-3: Strongly Disjointed<br>
Minimal branding consistency. There are no shared navigational elements, visual language diverges significantly. The journal feels externally hosted or partner-run.
<br>-2: Loosely Connected<br>
Some visual cues may hint at a shared origin (e.g., small logo in footer), but there are no platform integrations. Navigation between the two requires separate logins or feels like entering a different ecosystem.
<br>-1: Marginal Connection<br>
The journal is linked through a general navigation element or section on the main site, but branding alignment is weak and there’s no UX continuity.
<br>0: Neutral Alignment<br>
The sites reference one another, have similar tone or brand palettes, but still operate independently. They live in parallel rather than in union.
<br>+1: Light Branding Alignment<br>
Shared branding (colors, logos) is present, but UX remains distinct. Some minor crossover (e.g., shared footer elements).
<br>+2: Branded Pathway<br>
There’s a branded experience leading from the main site to the journal, and some consistent UX elements (like nav structure or shared user accounts).
<br>+3: Cohesive Design Language<br>
Both properties share a design system, layout patterns, and navigation is continuous or consistent. It feels like an extension of one site to another.
<br>+4: Fully Unified<br>
The journal and main site are on the same domain or subdomain, with seamless navigation, identical branding, and fully integrated UX. It feels like one holistic site.

Score: 35 – Great; Could Benefit from Minor Edits<br>Breakdown:<br><br>Summary:<br>
Heart.org performs reasonably well for an educated general audience. It offers a mix of technical and accessible vocabulary, and while sentence length and density are moderate, content is largely digestible. The tone is professional, and medical jargon is often defined, especially in patient-facing sections. The layout supports decent scannability, though CTA buttons could be clearer, more action-oriented, but using some great focused text for CTA.<br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 3 million monthly visitors.<br>
Estimated Membership Numbers: Over 33 million volunteers and supporters.<br><br><br>Explanation: The main site (heart.org) and the journal site (ahajournals.org) operate on separate domains with distinct branding and navigation. While there are links between them, the user experience is not seamless, indicating a loosely connected integration.<br>
<br>Landing Page for the full list of publications not even on the main site but on the Professional Heart.
<br>Minimal top 5 teaser articles<br>
Explanation: The main site focuses on general public education, advocacy, and patient resources, whereas the journal site is dedicated to scientific publications. The content serves different audiences with minimal overlap.
<br><br>Explanation: The main site offers the majority of its content—including patient education, healthy living resources, donation opportunities, and volunteer programs—freely available to the public. While professional tools and journal access may require membership or payment, these are not part of the main site’s public-facing content. <br>
<br>Most of the content is on Proffesional.heart.org so much so the login doesn't show up until the user is on that subdomain.
<br>Strong Brand holds the Subs together but the main nav is "Teased" on the main site but the entire nav swaps out when your in that experience.<br>
Explanation: The site includes information on getting involved through volunteering, donations, and becoming a heart health advocate. However, there’s less emphasis on structured onboarding for new members or supporters—details are available but not spotlighted or guided with a welcoming narrative. It’s informative but not highly personalized or welcoming.  
<br>There is a complete separate website for the professional where they ask people to become part of the org. 
<br><br>Explanation: The AHA addresses both the general public and professionals, offering resources ranging from patient education to scientific research, reflecting a broad inclusivity.​ The content is designed to be accessible and relevant to a broad audience, including the general public, patients, and caregivers, without requiring specialized medical knowledge.<br>
Explanation: The tone across AHA's platforms is professional yet accessible, aiming to engage a wide audience without compromising on scientific integrity.<br><br><br>Radar Chart Scores:<br>
<br>

<br>
Donations &amp; Philanthropy: ★★★★★  

<br>
Events: ★★☆☆☆  

<br>
Scientific Publications / Latest Science: ★☆☆☆☆  

<br>

<br>
Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: ★★★★★  

<br>
Education: ★★☆☆☆  

<br>
Advocacy: ★☆☆☆☆<br>
Rationale:

<br>
Membership &amp; Networking Opportunities:  Minimal presence on heart.org. Professional networking largely lives off-site or in conference contexts.

<br>
Donations &amp; Philanthropy: Highly visible and emphasized, with multiple calls to donate, fundraise, or give in honor of someone.

<br>
Events: Community events like Heart Walks and Go Red for Women are promoted, but less focus on large-scale scientific events or purchasable events.

<br>
Scientific Publications / Latest Science: Virtually absent from the main site; most science communication is generalized for lay audiences.

<br>
Practice Support Resources: Some tools for CPR, emergency response, and guidelines for laypersons exist, but not robust clinical tools unless you know where you are going and then you can find an equivalent to NCDR with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines" data-href="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines" href="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Get with the Guideline Registry</a>.

<br>
Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: Heart.org excels in this category, offering rich educational content, risk assessments, and interactive tools.

<br>
Education: Strong emphasis on public education, and awareness campaigns But limited training courses (like CPR), and no purchasable continuing education or modules for medical professionals. All reference to continuing learning is buried on the main site and is mostly hosted on its E-learning Sub Domain.  elearn.heart.org 

<br>
Advocacy: It is on the site but it is very hard to find but does exist.

<br><br><br>
<br>Art Direction strong visual branding with single color usage the red and white. High usage of photos because of their public facing mission that humanizes the site. 

<br>Extra Care on all pages to reserve "button" for limited usage because of the single color branding.  
<br>Red in the UI is dropped in tone in the UI so it has proper contrast.

 <br><br>Higher Score the better.<br><br><br><br>Short Analysis: <br>
<br>AAN and HFSA are the best overall performers — very even across all areas.

<br>AMA is strong, but slightly less precise in CTA clarity.
<br>AHA and ESC are strong but could simplify insider vocab slightly more.

Score:  20<br>
<br>Classification: Below Average; Requires Revision
<br><br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 1.1 million monthly visits.<br>
Estimated Membership Numbers: Over 56,000 members, encompassing a diverse range of cardiovascular professionals. <br><br><br>The main site (ACC.org) and the journal site (JACC.org) are distinct in branding and navigation. While ACC.org provides a link to JACC.org, the journal site operates independently with its own navigation and content structure. The content overlap is moderate; ACC.org references JACC articles, but the journal content is primarily housed separately.<br><br>A very disjunctive experience between the two space but with all of the interconnected hand offs between the two sites and the non-descriptive branding the experience comes out muddled and users will often not understand they a have left one domain for the other.<br><br><br>ACC.org offers a mix of open-access and member-restricted content. Educational resources and certain tools require membership login. The onboarding process is streamlined, with clear pathways for different professional roles and an eligibility calculator for prospective members.<br><br>The site largely seems unlocked and most articles and site are unlocked thought it makes easy access to the site and the content produced by the org it lacks a certain presentation to the value of Membership or what a user might get to if the content was more locked down. <br><br><br>The site primarily targets cardiovascular professionals, with content tailored to their needs. The tone is formal and clinical, appropriate for a professional medical audience, but lacks broader inclusivity or expressive engagement visitors.  Most language lacks pro-nouns, and mostly proper nouns.  This language is professional but doesn't match to modern web language. <br>Effect on UX the tone can come across as overly wordy to cold.

<br>Explanation: ACC.org places a strong emphasis on scientific publications and educational resources, evident through its extensive guidelines and learning materials. Events, such as the ACC.25 conference, are prominently featured. While there are networking opportunities and patient-facing tools like CardioSmart, these areas are less emphasized compared to the organization's core focus on science and education.<br><br>]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/associations/acc-american-college-of-cardiology.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/ACC -- American College of Cardiology.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 13:29:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AAN -- American Academy of Neurology]]></title><description><![CDATA[

~38,000 members (official AAN membership figures)<br><br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
The Neurology® journal is operated under <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.neurology.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.neurology.org/" target="_blank">neurology.org</a>, branded clearly as the AAN’s journal.<br>
<br>Visual styling is separate and more typical of academic publishing, but there are cross-links back to AAN.com (e.g., navigation mentions AAN membership, benefits).
<br>Content access is tied to AAN membership in some cases (members get full-text access for certain journals).
<br>There is significant Marketing that is one way from AAN to the Neurology Journals but rarely in reverse.
<br>The journal site’s focus is purely research articles, clinical trials, and scientific reviews — no duplication of AAN’s broader professional education, advocacy, or event content.
<br><br>Explanation:<br>
Many public resources — news, events, practice tools, advocacy — are open-access. Member-exclusive content includes guidelines, CME opportunities, and deeper clinical resources. New members are welcomed through clear onboarding steps, including member portals, community forums, and structured orientation emails.<br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
AAN’s primary audience remains clinical neurologists and researchers, which gives it a somewhat professional insider focus. However, the tone is notably friendly, with conversational but authoritative messaging. Patient-facing content is present but secondary.<br><br><br>Scores:<br>

<br>Explanation:<br>
AAN is strong across education, latest science, and practice support. Member networking is solid but not dominant.

 <br><br><br>
<br>Ensure the site provides immediate feedback for user actions, such as logging in, submitting forms, or loading pages, so users know their actions are being processed.
<br><br>
<br>The content and navigation should use terms and language that resonate with your audience (e.g., "My Courses," "Membership Dashboard," "Explore Articles") to make the site intuitive.
<br><br>
<br>Users should be able to easily navigate between sections, undo actions, and go back without confusion, especially when managing membership details or course enrollments.
<br><br>
<br>The design, layout, and labeling should remain consistent across the site, whether users are in the membership area, reading articles, or accessing educational content.
<br><br>
<br>Provide users with clear, guided steps to minimize mistakes, particularly in processes like signing up for a membership, enrolling in a course, or making a purchase.
<br><br>
<br>Reduce the need for users to remember details by displaying key information clearly, such as membership status, progress in courses, and recommended articles.
<br><br>
<br>Design for both new and experienced users, allowing shortcuts and advanced features (like filtering or bookmarking) for members who visit frequently while keeping it simple for new visitors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that pages are visually simple and easy to navigate, focusing on the most important actions like reading articles, accessing courses, or checking membership benefits.
<br><br>
<br>If something goes wrong, provide a clear explanation and actionable steps to resolve the issue, such as payment problems or content loading errors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that users can quickly find help through FAQs, support articles, or a contact option, especially when they are having trouble with their membership, accessing courses, or reading content.

<br>No clear division between Enterprise Domains.

<br>Clear Usage, Focus of Efforts, Reasons to Deploy within each Domain. 

<br>Why should something be found in JACC and not ACC or CardioSmart. 




<br>Central Login with our Family of Products. 

<br>Cross walking our Enterprise is a jarring. 


<br>No structural plans for how to scale content onto the site. 
<br>Disjointed implementation of Design. (Lack of Creative Direction Enforcement) 

<br>Need ACC to have enough built out so we don't run into "it needs to be NEW UI"
<br>Need a process to "Accept new UI"
<br>Need to know who and what is being built so we can police it. (UX and CS)
<br>Need the power to enforce. We can be overruled.


<br>Maintenance Issue (slow to fix, slow to change)

<br>Resources limitations causes errors and fixes to languish for weeks to even years.

<br>Grid Box Error
<br>Membership Section Announcements
<br>SWG improvements
<br>Arches Conversion
<br>Forsee errors should make a jira hot fix.




<br>Pain Points are training users to alter their behavior. 

<br>Mobile is painful so they use desktops
<br>Purchased Product Entry Points are hard to find so users go back to the original purchase page
<br>Nothing changes when I login so why should I.
<br>Science is hard to find so they go somewhere else....


<br>Load Times

<br>Optimization of Code, Loaded Content to Page, Slow to Paint Page.  

<br>Still looking at 4-6 seconds to load official standard of the web is .1




<br>Back End Editing is Painful

<br>Components are hard to find, organization is confused and mixed with legacy and arches and never use.
<br>Components need a combination of Experience Editor and Detail View
<br>SiteCore likes to alter and "lint" html between Source and WYSIWYG
<br>I don't know if this is a sitecore problem or an us problem.


<br>No real way to test (from a base setup)

<br>A/B
<br>Funnel Tracking 


<br>We have branching pages that give no value besides wiring the pages together

 <br><br><br>
<br>Ensure the site provides immediate feedback for user actions, such as logging in, submitting forms, or loading pages, so users know their actions are being processed.
<br><br>
<br>The content and navigation should use terms and language that resonate with your audience (e.g., "My Courses," "Membership Dashboard," "Explore Articles") to make the site intuitive.
<br><br>
<br>Users should be able to easily navigate between sections, undo actions, and go back without confusion, especially when managing membership details or course enrollments.
<br><br>
<br>The design, layout, and labeling should remain consistent across the site, whether users are in the membership area, reading articles, or accessing educational content.
<br><br>
<br>Provide users with clear, guided steps to minimize mistakes, particularly in processes like signing up for a membership, enrolling in a course, or making a purchase.
<br><br>
<br>Reduce the need for users to remember details by displaying key information clearly, such as membership status, progress in courses, and recommended articles.
<br><br>
<br>Design for both new and experienced users, allowing shortcuts and advanced features (like filtering or bookmarking) for members who visit frequently while keeping it simple for new visitors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that pages are visually simple and easy to navigate, focusing on the most important actions like reading articles, accessing courses, or checking membership benefits.
<br><br>
<br>If something goes wrong, provide a clear explanation and actionable steps to resolve the issue, such as payment problems or content loading errors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that users can quickly find help through FAQs, support articles, or a contact option, especially when they are having trouble with their membership, accessing courses, or reading content.

 <br><br>To effectively explore our competitive landscape, this survey aimed to uncover both direct and indirect competition regarding features and benefits offered by ACC.org. While direct comparison against our field is valuable, we should also consider how we compete on features and user experience beyond the cardiovascular care space. Users are multifaceted, interacting daily with experiences related to education, membership, events, reading articles, and news across various industries. Understanding how these elements are presented on the best platforms across the web will provide insights into expectations and best practices that can elevate ACC.org. This survey will help reveal which competitors are challenging ACC.org regarding user experience across offerings like education, certifications, membership, events, and news engagement.<br><br><br>

<br>
-4: Academically Formal<br>
Language mirrors academic journals or internal policy documents. Densely written, passive voice dominates. Heavy use of jargon, acronyms, and formal third-person. Prioritizes precision over connection—reads like it’s meant for peer reviewers, not people.

<br>
-3: Rigid and Impersonal<br>
Tone is extremely formal and serious. Often sounds like a compliance document or corporate report. Still technical but spells out terms. Reads like it’s trying to avoid liability more than inform or inspire.

<br>
-2: Dry and Technical<br>
Information is accurate but lacking human warmth. Text reads like textbooks or white papers—clarity exists, but personality is absent. Occasional headings help, but voice is purely mechanical.

<br>
-1: Flat with Occasional Warmth<br>
Generally neutral and professional, with rare moments of friendliness. Might use plain language or some light subheads, but lacks a consistent effort to be human or engaging.

<br>
0: Approachable Professional<br>
Balanced and clear. Uses active voice and plain language without dumbing it down. Minimally expressive but readable and human. Feels like it was written by a professional for another professional—welcoming without being casual.<br>


<br>
+1: Slightly Conversational<br>
Begins to use softer language, rhetorical questions, or more inviting phrasing. Feels less like a document and more like a person.<br>


<br>
+2: Friendly and Professional<br>
Conversational, confident, and approachable. Clear identity in voice without losing credibility or clarity.<br>


<br>
+3: Warm and Engaging<br>
Actively uses tone to build rapport. Strong emphasis on accessibility, encouragement, and human touch. May include inclusive phrasing and emotional cues.<br>


<br>
+4: Fully Expressive<br>
Bold, vibrant tone with emotional resonance. Uses storytelling, rhetorical flair, and confident voice to create deep engagement and connection.

<br>-4: Off-Site or Hidden<br>
There is no visible path to membership from the main site. Membership is handled on a separate domain, microsite, or poorly connected property. The process feels buried or unrelated.<br>

<br>-2: Minimally Present<br>
Membership exists but is not emphasized. A small “Join” link may be present, but there is little information about benefits, processes, or why someone should join.<br>

<br>0: Neutral Presence<br>
The site includes a membership section or page, but it’s not highlighted in the primary user journey. Information is available but not persuasive or well integrated.<br>

<br>+2: Guided Invitation<br>
Membership is clearly positioned as a part of the organization’s purpose. There's a clear, accessible call to action, with content describing the benefits and process, even if modest in presentation.<br>

<br>+4: Fully Welcoming<br>
The site uses engaging language and visuals to invite membership. The value proposition is clear, and onboarding is embedded into the experience—through guided flows, testimonials, benefit breakdowns, and visible CTAs across the site.

<br>-4: Fully Disconnected<br>
The journal and main site feel entirely unrelated. There is no shared branding, platform, or navigation. A user would not be able to tell the journal is part of the same association.
<br>-3: Strongly Disjointed<br>
Minimal branding consistency. There are no shared navigational elements, visual language diverges significantly. The journal feels externally hosted or partner-run.
<br>-2: Loosely Connected<br>
Some visual cues may hint at a shared origin (e.g., small logo in footer), but there are no platform integrations. Navigation between the two requires separate logins or feels like entering a different ecosystem.
<br>-1: Marginal Connection<br>
The journal is linked through a general navigation element or section on the main site, but branding alignment is weak and there’s no UX continuity.
<br>0: Neutral Alignment<br>
The sites reference one another, have similar tone or brand palettes, but still operate independently. They live in parallel rather than in union.
<br>+1: Light Branding Alignment<br>
Shared branding (colors, logos) is present, but UX remains distinct. Some minor crossover (e.g., shared footer elements).
<br>+2: Branded Pathway<br>
There’s a branded experience leading from the main site to the journal, and some consistent UX elements (like nav structure or shared user accounts).
<br>+3: Cohesive Design Language<br>
Both properties share a design system, layout patterns, and navigation is continuous or consistent. It feels like an extension of one site to another.
<br>+4: Fully Unified<br>
The journal and main site are on the same domain or subdomain, with seamless navigation, identical branding, and fully integrated UX. It feels like one holistic site.

<br>-4: Fully Duplicated<br>
The main site republishes journal content directly, with minimal or no modification. Articles appear verbatim or are routinely mirrored. 
<br>-3: Derivative Duplication<br>
The main site frequently features adapted or summarized versions of journal articles. There’s heavy content recycling in different formats (e.g., blog posts, highlights, infographics).
<br>-2: Featured Cross-Publication<br>
Journal content is regularly spotlighted on the main site through excerpts, featured articles, or summaries. There’s a clear editorial flow from journal to main.
<br>-1: Light Journal Echoing<br>
Occasional journal content appears on the main site—select articles or issues are highlighted in news sections or as updates.
<br>0: Reference Integration<br>
The main site discusses the journal broadly, possibly with multiple references or deep links, but does not reuse actual content.
<br>+1: Deep Link Framing<br>
The main site promotes its journal through deep links to individual issues or articles, but without embedding or echoing the content itself.
<br>+2: Journal Link Presence<br>
The main site acknowledges the journal’s existence and links to it (usually at a high level like “Our Journal”), but without further editorial emphasis or content reuse.
<br>+3: Minimal Journal Exposure<br>
Journal presence is limited to a basic link or navigation tab. The main site content remains separate and self-contained.
<br>+4: Fully Distinct<br>
There is no shared content between the main site and journal. The journal is neither referenced nor discoverable through content pathways. Each site has its own editorial ecosystem.

<br>-4: Fully Locked<br>
Nearly all content is inaccessible without logging in or becoming a member. The public view offers only basic information (e.g., About page or login screen). 
<br>-3: Highly Restricted<br>
Most core content—such as articles, resources, tools, and even some navigation—is locked behind a member wall or requires login. Public access is very limited.
<br>-2: Partially Locked<br>
Many areas of the site (e.g., entire article categories, tools, or educational resources) require a member login. Public visitors encounter frequent access walls.
<br>-1: Targeted Restrictions<br>
Specific high-value content types (e.g., publications, event registrations, or toolkits) are gated for members, but general site content is open.
<br>0: Neutral Locking<br>
A mix of open and gated content, with some clear benefits reserved for members but without pervasive access control across the site.
<br>+1: Light Gating<br>
Most content is accessible without login, but membership offers enhanced experiences (e.g., downloads, personal dashboards, advanced tools).
<br>+2: Minimal Locking<br>
Only select areas, like purchasable products, exclusive webinars, or certifications, require member login. General content is open and searchable.
<br>+3: Open with Optional Login<br>
The site operates fully in public view. Login is only needed for personalization or e-commerce transactions, not for accessing substantive content.
<br>+4: Fully Open<br>
No clear locking mechanism is visible. All content appears available to the public, with little to no incentive or requirement to become a member for access.

<br>-4: Hyper-Specialized Professionals<br>
Content is designed for a narrow expert audience within a medical subspecialty (e.g., electrophysiologists, heart failure specialists). Assumes advanced, specialized knowledge.
<br>-3: Specialized Professionals<br>
Targets a specific field of professionals (e.g., general cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons). Language and tools are tailored for those practicing in that domain.
<br>-2: Field-Specific Professionals<br>
Appeals to the full range of professionals within a medical field (e.g., all roles within cardiology including clinicians, researchers, and educators). Still assumes a shared base of field-specific knowledge.
<br>-1: Broader Healthcare Professionals<br>
Engages professionals outside the core field, such as nurses, physician assistants, technicians, and allied health staff working in related areas (e.g., cardiovascular support teams).
<br>0: Educated Patients<br>
Engages with the entire professional community and engages with the educated patients.
<br>+1: Informed or Affected Public<br>
Accessible to patients, caregivers, or individuals affected by health issues (e.g., heart disease), though professional content remains distinct and primary.
<br>+2: Educated Public<br>
Reaches out to general audiences interested in health topics, such as students, advocates, or fitness professionals. Medical language is simplified where needed.
<br>+3: Public-Oriented<br>
Content is framed for lay audiences with little or no medical background. Emphasis is on education, awareness, and broad understanding.
<br>+4: Fully Inclusive<br>
Designed to be understood by the general public regardless of background, with clear, jargon-free messaging and wide community appeal.

<br><br>Membership &amp; Networking Opportunities: JACC.org includes limited information on membership engagement and networking, which can be difficult to find. Networking opportunities are typically tied to scientific conferences and may appear briefly in the homepage carousel. There's potential confusion between journal subscriptions and ACC membership — subscriptions are a type of membership and users can subscribe without being ACC members. There is no clear connection is made between JACC content and ACC member benefits. The site could better promote member value by linking to ACC membership.&nbsp;<br>Donations &amp; Philanthropy: JACC.org hosts very few articles that reference donations and philanthropy on the site, but no direct links or dedicated sections for donations.​ Search engine results return article links related to organ donation on JACC.org.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Events: Specific events are temporarily promoted on the website carousel, however users must access the Events section using the navigation menu.

However, there is no help and guidance on how to professionally run a practice.&nbsp;<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: While some articles mention patient-facing tools, there is no dedicated section or prominent links for patient resources on the homepage or main navigation. Users would need to search extensively to find such content, indicating a low emphasis on patient-facing initiatives.&nbsp;<br>Education: Access to educational content (CME/MOC) is present on JACC.org, including articles on medical education. However, the page content directs users to Learn.acc.org.&nbsp;<br>Advocacy: JACC.org lacks a dedicated advocacy section.

The Heart Rhythm Journal is completely separate from the HRS website:<br>
<br>It operates on an entirely different domain (heartrhythmjournal.com), run through Elsevier.
<br>Branding, navigation, and user journeys are completely siloed — there are no obvious cross-links back to the HRS main site, nor any integrated experience for HRS members.
<br>Full journal access flows externally; it feels like an independent publishing platform rather than an extension of the HRS organization.
<br>Content is distinctly scientific and does not overlap with HRS’s broader event, patient, or professional education materials.
<br>The +.5 is because there is a decent amount of marketing effort on the pages to direct users to the journals.
<br>+1 the branding of the journal site has echos and is very clear that the Journal is produced by the HRS.<br>
Thus, this pairing is disconnected with connective DNA with very low/no overlap in content.
<br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
The majority of event summaries, patient tools, and basic professional resources are freely accessible. Deeper educational materials, full conference recordings, and certain guidelines are gated for members. There's a relatively friendly and proactive onboarding pathway — clear "Join Now" CTAs, member value propositions, and defined next steps post-registration.<br><br><br>The primary audience is still electrophysiologists and cardiac device professionals, making the experience somewhat insider-focused. However, the tone of writing is noticeably friendlier and more humanized compared to peers like HFSA. The voice is professional without being overly dry, especially in patient-facing pages and public health initiatives.<br><br><br>Scores:<br>

<br>Explanation:<br>
HRS places major emphasis on events (especially Heart Rhythm Annual Meeting), education, and scientific updates. Networking exists but is not hyper-prominent.

A journal section that outlines the journal product lives on the main site but the Journal is outside HFSA domain and lacks any visual or navigational unity with the main site. There are plenty of content that is derivative of the journal on the main site but most full-content links redirect users away from HFSA.org. There are minimal cross-links or integrated member pathways between the journal back to the main site, but plenty that go from the main site to the journal. <br>

The site’s tone caters mostly to professionals but includes patient sections to broaden reach, making it somewhat inclusive.

Enhance Your Heart Failure Career with HFSA Membership <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://youtu.be/LOh75iLOEHs" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/LOh75iLOEHs</a> 
<br>Donations: Mostly missing from the site there is some reference to becoming a sponsor from a corporate level but their finances seem to come from other streams of revenue.
<br>Events: There are events sponsored from the HFS with an ongoing calendar with a co-mingle of external events showing a delegation technique that makes their events seem more robust then what they can personally produce.
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science:. The main site does have some medical news but mostly in the view point of Industry.  All other science is point away to their disconnected journal.
<br>Practice Support Resources:  This seems to be their most lacking area of the site. Most practice support is more in the tone of Patient collaboration tools and practically nothing around the business.
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content:  A full suite of content: Events, Webinars, and articles.
<br>Education: Though education is clearly a focus for this organization is a supportive mechanism for them and is not segmented out so it is dispersed under membership, professional development, and patients.
<br>Advocacy:  Clearly important as a benefit and why users want to be a part of this org.
<br><br><br>
<br>SPONSORSHIP INTEGRATIONS: Donations come from Sponsorship and this reflects in other spaces like events, and education.  The small organization utilizes these 3rd Party production sources to enrich their calendar and educational spaces making those areas much more robust then what they could produce on their own. 
<br>Derivatives are page items on the main site vs the journal area.

Score: 35 – Good; Minor Tweaks Only<br>Breakdown:<br><br>Summary:<br>
ESC’s website is structured cleanly for professional and academic users. The reading level suits clinicians and researchers, with technical vocabulary prevalent throughout. Some jargon appears without consistent definition, especially in professional news articles. Sentence structures are a bit formal and often lean passive, though the layout and design promote good scan-ability. CTAs could be stronger to drive user action more clearly.<br><br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 1.2 million monthly visitors, according to Similarweb.​<br>
Estimated Membership Numbers: Over 105,000 healthcare professionals worldwide.<br><br>Integration of Experience:  <br>Explanation: Since the journal content is fully integrated within the main escardio.org domain with consistent branding and top-level navigation access, the user experience is relatively unified. Although some journal content may still open in external viewer windows, the structural integration supports a more cohesive experience.<br>Content Overlap:<br>
Explanation: The journals and the main site both target healthcare professionals, and while their formats differ (news/guidelines vs. academic papers), their thematic overlap is clear. Users encounter both journal links and practice guidance fluidly in the same experience, without unnecessary duplication.<br><br>Content Locking:<br>
Explanation: Access to certain resources, such as full guidelines and educational materials, requires membership or payment, indicating partial content locking.​<br>Onboarding:<br>
Explanation: The ESC provides clear pathways for professionals to join, with detailed information on membership benefits, suggesting a well-structured onboarding process.​<br><br>Audience Focus:<br>
Explanation: The ESC primarily targets healthcare professionals, with limited resources for the general public, indicating a somewhat inclusive audience focus.​<br>Tone &amp; Expression:<br>
Explanation: The tone across ESC's platforms is professional yet accessible, aiming to engage healthcare professionals without compromising on scientific integrity.​<br><br><br>Radar Chart Scores:<br>

<br>Advocacy: ★☆☆☆☆  
<br>Rationale:<br>
<br>Member Networking Opportunities: The ESC offers networking through its associations, working groups, and events, providing ample opportunities for professional connections.​
<br>Donations &amp; Philanthropy: While the ESC is a nonprofit organization, there is limited reference public fundraising or philanthropic campaigns on the main site.​ I can't find any significant mention on if you can donate and the current google reference to a donation page 404's
<br>Events: The ESC hosts numerous events, including the prominent ESC Congress, catering to healthcare professionals globally, but most of its Event content is co-mingled and content-centric with the news on ESC 365.​
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science: With a suite of high-impact journals and regular updates, the ESC continually published a well connected campaign around cardiovascular research.​
<br>Practice Support Resources: Provides guidelines and tools for healthcare, but practically missing any materials around practice support I would expect that is partially because the audience is the EU and that level of information would be shaped by the country level and would be to complex to outline at this organizations level.
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: The primary focus remains on healthcare professionals, and  barely any educational materials for patients, and I am not sure if I found any for a patient that was looking for any basic information.
<br>Education: Delivers a range of educational programs and certifications, such as online courses and webinars, for healthcare professionals, but mostly pushing off to it E-learn site to house the marketing..
>>>>>>> 4db61ff (just checking in)

<br>Advocacy: You can find note of advocacy deep with in the sections of the site but they are clearly connected with the iniatives and you would need to know they are there and more hidden then present on the site.


<br><br><br><br>A remarkably polished site. There is use of both graphics and photos which does sometimes challenge the focus of the art direction, but UI standards across the site in such an expensive manner is well held together. Clearly there is a design system utilized, and this site being relatively young is not showing any markers of age or deviating from the strategic content alignment.  <br><br>The only negative I can really put against the ESC is even at their reduced focus of scope, comparative to the other associations in our review the produce a lot and the site is very expansive. They are pushing the edges of what can be easily discoverable, and I am sure there is more content that a user would have to dig for. I am curious how they deal with those constructs and limitations. <br><br>I do want to note their clinical documents page at first usage is not the greatest answer for there overwhelming content problem because more items are hidden than easily discoverable.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\projects\acc-redesign\discovery\associations\esc-european-society-of-cardiology.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/ESC -- European Society of Cardiology.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AHA -- American Heart Association]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Score: 35 – Great; Could Benefit from Minor Edits<br>Breakdown:<br><br>Summary:<br>
Heart.org performs reasonably well for an educated general audience. It offers a mix of technical and accessible vocabulary, and while sentence length and density are moderate, content is largely digestible. The tone is professional, and medical jargon is often defined, especially in patient-facing sections. The layout supports decent scannability, though CTA buttons could be clearer, more action-oriented, but using some great focused text for CTA.<br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 3 million monthly visitors.<br>
Estimated Membership Numbers: Over 33 million volunteers and supporters.<br><br><br>Explanation: The main site (heart.org) and the journal site (ahajournals.org) operate on separate domains with distinct branding and navigation. While there are links between them, the user experience is not seamless, indicating a loosely connected integration.<br>
<br>Landing Page for the full list of publications not even on the main site but on the Professional Heart.
<br>Minimal top 5 teaser articles<br>
Explanation: The main site focuses on general public education, advocacy, and patient resources, whereas the journal site is dedicated to scientific publications. The content serves different audiences with minimal overlap.
<br><br>Explanation: The main site offers the majority of its content—including patient education, healthy living resources, donation opportunities, and volunteer programs—freely available to the public. While professional tools and journal access may require membership or payment, these are not part of the main site’s public-facing content. <br>
<br>Most of the content is on Proffesional.heart.org so much so the login doesn't show up until the user is on that subdomain.
<br>Strong Brand holds the Subs together but the main nav is "Teased" on the main site but the entire nav swaps out when your in that experience.<br>
Explanation: The site includes information on getting involved through volunteering, donations, and becoming a heart health advocate. However, there’s less emphasis on structured onboarding for new members or supporters—details are available but not spotlighted or guided with a welcoming narrative. It’s informative but not highly personalized or welcoming.  
<br>There is a complete separate website for the professional where they ask people to become part of the org. 
<br><br>Explanation: The AHA addresses both the general public and professionals, offering resources ranging from patient education to scientific research, reflecting a broad inclusivity.​ The content is designed to be accessible and relevant to a broad audience, including the general public, patients, and caregivers, without requiring specialized medical knowledge.<br>
Explanation: The tone across AHA's platforms is professional yet accessible, aiming to engage a wide audience without compromising on scientific integrity.<br><br><br>Radar Chart Scores:<br>

<br>
Donations &amp; Philanthropy: Highly visible and emphasized, with multiple calls to donate, fundraise, or give in honor of someone.

<br>
Events: Community events like Heart Walks and Go Red for Women are promoted, but less focus on large-scale scientific events or purchasable events.

<br>
Scientific Publications / Latest Science: Virtually absent from the main site; most science communication is generalized for lay audiences.

<br>
Practice Support Resources: Some tools for CPR, emergency response, and guidelines for laypersons exist, but not robust clinical tools unless you know where you are going and then you can find an equivalent to NCDR with <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines" data-href="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines" href="https://www.heart.org/en/professional/quality-improvement/get-with-the-guidelines" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Get with the Guideline Registry</a>.

<br>
Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: Heart.org excels in this category, offering rich educational content, risk assessments, and interactive tools.

<br>
Education: Strong emphasis on public education, and awareness campaigns But limited training courses (like CPR), and no purchasable continuing education or modules for medical professionals. All reference to continuing learning is buried on the main site and is mostly hosted on its E-learning Sub Domain.  elearn.heart.org 

<br>
Advocacy: It is on the site but it is very hard to find but does exist.

<br><br><br>
<br>Art Direction strong visual branding with single color usage the red and white. High usage of photos because of their public facing mission that humanizes the site. 

<br>Extra Care on all pages to reserve "button" for limited usage because of the single color branding.  
<br>Red in the UI is dropped in tone in the UI so it has proper contrast. 


<br>Structure of the content is spread across multiple sites where the main site is much more Advocacy, Public Education with pass offs to the sister sites. Clear focus of audience and cleaning away distractions. 
<br>Cleanliness is a focus of all pages.

<br>Dates only show up when referencing things that are "latest" 
<br>Listed items are almost always reserved to less then 5 items.
<br>Sub Domain-ing with altering Context and Main Nav

<br>CPR.heart.org
<br>Learn.heart.org
<br>Professional.heart.org
<br>....




<br><br>The subduing is markable, interesting and allows for greater division of audience and improves focus, but it does impede discoverability, and only because this research has forced deep diving into their content. Did I discover some of the nuanced areas. It is very easy as an audience member or user to be confused about why the main is altering because the branding is so locked up the edges between the main site and CPR, for example, are minimal and a user might just be shocked that they may NAV item that they were utilizing disappears. ]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\projects\acc-redesign\discovery\associations\aha-american-heart-association.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/AHA -- American Heart Association.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[AMA -- American Medical Association]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Score: 36 – Good; Minor Tweaks Only<br>Breakdown:<br><br>Summary: The AMA's website exhibits a professional tone with clear calls to action and well-structured content. While the vocabulary is generally accessible, occasional medical jargon could be further simplified or defined to enhance understanding for a broader audience.​<br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 847,000 site users, with over 952,000 site visits reported in a recent period. ​<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/ama-advocacy-efforts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/system/files/ama-advocacy-efforts.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a><br>Estimated Membership Numbers: As of December 2023, the AMA reported 282,952 members, including physicians and medical students.<br><br><br><br>Rationale: The AMA's main site (ama-assn.org) and the JAMA Network (jamanetwork.com) operate on separate domains with distinct branding and navigation structures. Minimal links between the two—such as the AMA site directing users to the JAMA Network for publications—the user experience is disjointed. Users must navigate between different interfaces, and there is no unified account system or integrated search functionality across both platforms. This separation indicates a loosely connected integration of experience.​<br>
<br>No logo Sharing
<br>No Design Sharing
<br>Barely Spells out JAMA
<br>Science Only
<br><br>Rationale: The content between the AMA main site and the JAMA Network is largely distinct. The AMA site focuses on advocacy, medical education, and professional resources, while the JAMA Network is dedicated to publishing peer-reviewed medical research. Although both platforms serve medical professionals and are under the AMA umbrella, their content offerings do not significantly overlap, indicating a low content overlap.​<br>
<br>Links to the Journal
<br>But Content is More business and "Policy" oriented and all "Science" is reserved for the Journal Site and it is true vice versa.
<br><br>Rationale: The AMA offers certain resources, such as CME options and articles, to non-members, but full access to benefits like the JAMA Network and specific discounts requires membership. The onboarding process is streamlined, with clear pathways for different user groups (e.g., physicians, residents, students) to understand and access membership benefits.​<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.ama-assn.org/amaone/membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.ama-assn.org/amaone/membership?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">American Medical Association</a><br>
<br>Awesome benefit for Car Discounts :-)
<br><br>Rationale: The AMA's content is tailored to a wide range of medical professionals, including students, residents, and practicing physicians, indicating a broadly inclusive approach. The tone remains professional yet approachable, aiming to engage users effectively without excessive formality.​<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3153537/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3153537/?utm_source=chatgpt.com" target="_blank">PMC</a><br><br><br><br>

<br>Rationale:<br>
<br>Member Networking Opportunities: The AMA provides upfront member engagement and ask but unable to determine if there is a  platforms for members to connect, but there is room for enhancing interactive networking features.
<br>Donations &amp; Philanthropy: While the AMA engages in philanthropic activities the pages are buried on  the main site.
<br>Events: The organization annual meetings is located on the homepage but the other events that indicating a strong commitment to member engagement through events is hidden with in the long search bar. It is possible that behind membership walls this become more prominent or easier to find.
<br>Scientific Publications / Latest Science: With access to the JAMA Network and other publications, the AMA offers substantial scientific resources, but on the main site it is reserved to news elements about public health, practice, advocacy and the practice reserving the latest science to live only on Jama.
<br>Practice Support Resources: Resources are available articles are written to support medical practice management and an entire segment craft to multiple facets of practice support.
<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: The site primarily targets medical professionals, with limited content directly aimed at patients. this type of content is practically no where on the site.
<br>Education: Educational resources, including CME opportunities and the AMA Ed Hub, are robust and well-integrated into the site.
<br><br><br><br>AMA clearly has a design system library in place. The collection of UI pattern feels pretty high so there is a certain about of consistency degradation not because they aren't following the rules but because they have too many to really show a visual pattern. They have an extensive  collection of patterns makes the site feel a little clumsy and overwhelming high usage of images that hold content and text utilizing font treatments that are not matching.<br><br>They collapse away their main NAV into a burger menu even on desktop when you are not on the homepage this is an interesting choice. I find it slightly frustrating because I am trying to move around the site as much. Maybe it isn't as much of an issue when users are being directed by Google and cross discovery isn't as important. It does reduce the overall visual noise which is pretty high on their site.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\projects\acc-redesign\discovery\associations\ama-american-medical-association.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/AMA -- American Medical Association.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[fACS -- American College of Surgeons]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<<<<<<< HEAD
<br>No clear division between Enterprise Domains.

<br>Clear Usage, Focus of Efforts, Reasons to Deploy within each Domain. 

<br>Why should something be found in JACC and not ACC or CardioSmart. 




<br>Central Login with our Family of Products. 

<br>Cross walking our Enterprise is a jarring. 


<br>No structural plans for how to scale content onto the site. 
<br>Disjointed implementation of Design. (Lack of Creative Direction Enforcement) 

<br>Need ACC to have enough built out so we don't run into "it needs to be NEW UI"
<br>Need a process to "Accept new UI"
<br>Need to know who and what is being built so we can police it. (UX and CS)
<br>Need the power to enforce. We can be overruled.


<br>Maintenance Issue (slow to fix, slow to change)

<br>Resources limitations causes errors and fixes to languish for weeks to even years.

<br>Grid Box Error
<br>Membership Section Announcements
<br>SWG improvements
<br>Arches Conversion
<br>Forsee errors should make a jira hot fix.




<br>Pain Points are training users to alter their behavior. 

<br>Mobile is painful so they use desktops
<br>Purchased Product Entry Points are hard to find so users go back to the original purchase page
<br>Nothing changes when I login so why should I.
<br>Science is hard to find so they go somewhere else....


<br>Load Times

<br>Optimization of Code, Loaded Content to Page, Slow to Paint Page.  

<br>Still looking at 4-6 seconds to load official standard of the web is .1




<br>Back End Editing is Painful

<br>Components are hard to find, organization is confused and mixed with legacy and arches and never use.
<br>Components need a combination of Experience Editor and Detail View
<br>SiteCore likes to alter and "lint" html between Source and WYSIWYG
<br>I don't know if this is a sitecore problem or an us problem.


<br>No real way to test (from a base setup)

<br>A/B
<br>Funnel Tracking 


<br>We have branching pages that give no value besides wiring the pages together
<br>Orphan Pages from the site experience
<br>FIX All Foresee Bugs
<br>Phase 2 and Maintenance is a Unicorn.
<br>Out of the list above what is a Content, Design, Process, Technical issues?]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/discovery/pain-points.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Pain Points.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 08 May 2025 18:48:04 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[UI Notes]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>ACC showcases the most meta-data around the article teaser comparative to its competitors.
<br>Most of the associations deal with their search result teasers differently than the embedded page teasers. 
<br>HFSA --  probably has the most confusing search results across the board. They're doing some form of grouping, but it doesn't come across how I think they intended it to.

<br>Hard distinguished articles
<br>Multiple levels of text hierarchies and use of multiple colors. 
<br>hard to distinguish what is interactive versus headline

 <br><br>Higher Score the better.<br><br><br><br>Short Analysis: <br>
<br>AAN and HFSA are the best overall performers — very even across all areas.
<br>HRS does slightly lag behind AAN and HFSA on Reading Level and Vocabulary but compensates with high scannability and clear CTAs.
<br>AMA is strong, but slightly less precise in CTA clarity.
<br>AHA and ESC are strong but could simplify insider vocab slightly more.
<br>ACC stands out for being much more academic and technical — not designed for a general or even lightly medical audience.
<br><img alt="readablity.png.png" src="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/lib/media/readablity.png.png"><br><br><br><br><br>
<br>ACC is substantially longer than the rest (about 60% longer than the next highest).
<br>AMA and AHA are moderately dense, rich but manageable   
<br>ACS, HFSA, and AAN cluster in the 500–700 word range — relatively compact.
<br>ESC is the most concise — under 500 words.

 <br><br>
<br>Solution: Provide a custom 404 page that clearly explains the page is not found, includes a search bar, and links to popular or important pages like the homepage or contact page.
<br>Tip: Add humorous or lighthearted content to ease frustration.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Display a clear message explaining the request was incorrect or malformed. Suggest actions the user can take, such as reloading the page or checking for errors in the URL.
<br>Tip: Guide users to report the issue if it persists.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Redirect users to a login page with a clear explanation that access requires authentication. Offer a link to reset passwords if needed.
<br>Tip: Keep the login process simple and user-friendly, avoiding unnecessary steps.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Inform the user that they don’t have permission to access the requested page, and suggest contacting support if they believe this is an error.
<br>Tip: If the user is logged out, consider prompting them to log in, if applicable.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Display a friendly error message stating that something went wrong on the server. Provide a link to the homepage or suggest the user try again later.
<br>Tip: Include an option to report the issue directly to the support team.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Explain that the server encountered an issue while acting as a gateway. Inform users this is likely a temporary issue and suggest trying again later.
<br>Tip: Offer a status page or contact option in case the problem persists.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Notify users that the service is temporarily unavailable due to server overload or maintenance. Include an estimated time for when the service will be back online, if possible.
<br>Tip: Add a subscription or notification option so users can be alerted when the site is back up.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Display a message indicating the server took too long to respond, and suggest refreshing the page or trying again later.
<br>Tip: Offer a link to check the site's status or provide a more interactive error page (e.g., FAQ section) that users can explore while waiting.
<br><br>(Suppress for Security only available non production)<br>
<br>Solution: Inform users that the request method they used is not allowed. Clearly state what methods are allowed (e.g., GET, POST) and offer navigation back to valid pages.
<br>Tip: Offer a clear explanation or auto-redirect to the homepage or main section of the site.
<br><br>
<br>Solution: Show users a message indicating their connection was too slow or the request took too long. Encourage them to check their internet connection or retry the action.
<br>Tip: Add a "Retry" button that automatically resubmits the request.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Politely inform users they’ve made too many requests in a short time and suggest waiting a few minutes before trying again.
<br>Tip: Include a countdown or time estimate for when they can try again.
<br><br>
<br>Solution: Clearly state that the requested page has been permanently removed and won’t be available again. Offer a search bar or links to other similar content.
<br>Tip: If the content has been moved, provide the new link or page.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Inform the user that the media format they tried to upload or access isn’t supported. Provide information on the types of media that are accepted.
<br>Tip: Offer a link to a help or FAQ page explaining how to format files for uploading.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Notify users that the requested functionality is not supported. Provide a suggestion for alternative actions or contact support if they require the missing feature.
<br>Tip: If it’s a planned feature, provide an option for users to sign up for updates on its development.
<br><br>
<br>Make It Easy to Navigate Away: Always include a clear path back to the homepage, a search bar, or popular sections so users can easily recover.
<br>Human-Friendly Language: Avoid using technical jargon in error messages. Use conversational language that’s easy to understand.
<br>Maintain Branding: Keep the error pages visually consistent with your site’s overall design and tone to maintain a cohesive experience.
<br>Track Errors for Improvement: Log and monitor these error codes to identify recurring issues and improve site performance over time.
<br>Here’s a list of critical error pages that should be suppressed or sanitized to improve security protection:<br><br>These errors can still be shown to the user but should be cleaned up to avoid exposing sensitive information.<br>
<br>500 - Internal Server Error
<br>400 - Bad Request
<br>502 - Bad Gateway
<br>503 - Service Unavailable
<br>504 - Gateway Timeout
<br>429 - Too Many Requests
<br><br>These errors should be replaced with generic messages to avoid disclosing details about access restrictions, authentication, or supported methods.<br>
<br>403 - Forbidden
<br>401 - Unauthorized
<br>405 - Method Not Allowed
<br><br>
<br>404 - Your heart is in the right place but the page doesn't seem to be there.<br>
Sorry to break you heart but his page isn't found.

=======
<br>Explanation:<br>
ACS is very strong on education, practice resources, and scientific updates. Networking and philanthropy are supported but not as dominant as their educational mission. Patient-facing content is present but takes a back seat to professional development.<br><br><br><br>One of the more interesting websites in relation to our direction is mostly around their shifting main NAV and hero image graphics. The impactful sweeping cut image doesn't always work perfectly because of content not constraining to the rules as much as they need to, but it does make a more visually impactful design. The rest of the site has a tight control on color, mostly a black to navy blue with small accents of red.<br><br>A surprising amount of images is across the site and though most likely stock it seems to be a professional grade. All images have the similar color, toning and keying, which allows all images to feel like they're from the same set. There is nothing that breaks from high contrast, a low contrast or saturated low saturation.<br><br>The site has an issue approach on main navigation with a three tiered separation of audience right off the bat from the homepage. This causes the main NAV to "personalize".   This is a great way for them to separate their concerns and focus their audiences. I'm curious what strategic documents they must have to make sure that content is placed in the right context and it is possible that they are just more accurate about dividing their audience use case because they only shift between (researcher, surgeon, patient), and do not have the nuanced audience platform that ACC has which is almost every medical profession level associated with cardiology.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\projects\acc-redesign\discovery\associations\facs-american-college-of-surgeons.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Discovery/Associations/fACS -- American College of Surgeons.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:30:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[ACC American College of Cardiology]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Classification: Below Average; Requires Revision
<br><br>Estimated Visitors: Approximately 1.1 million monthly visits.<br>
Estimated Membership Numbers: Over 56,000 members, encompassing a diverse range of cardiovascular professionals. <br><br><br>The main site (ACC.org) and the journal site (JACC.org) are distinct in branding and navigation. While ACC.org provides a link to JACC.org, the journal site operates independently with its own navigation and content structure. The content overlap is moderate; ACC.org references JACC articles, but the journal content is primarily housed separately.<br><br>A very disjunctive experience between the two space but with all of the interconnected hand offs between the two sites and the non-descriptive branding the experience comes out muddled and users will often not understand they a have left one domain for the other.<br><br><br>ACC.org offers a mix of open-access and member-restricted content. Educational resources and certain tools require membership login. The onboarding process is streamlined, with clear pathways for different professional roles and an eligibility calculator for prospective members.<br><br>The site largely seems unlocked and most articles and site are unlocked thought it makes easy access to the site and the content produced by the org it lacks a certain presentation to the value of Membership or what a user might get to if the content was more locked down. <br><br><br>The site primarily targets cardiovascular professionals, with content tailored to their needs. The tone is formal and clinical, appropriate for a professional medical audience, but lacks broader inclusivity or expressive engagement visitors.  Most language lacks pro-nouns, and mostly proper nouns.  This language is professional but doesn't match to modern web language. <br>Effect on UX the tone can come across as overly wordy to cold.

~250,000–300,000 monthly (based on SimilarWeb and traffic data)<br>Estimated Membership Numbers:<br>
~38,000 members (official AAN membership figures)<br><br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
The Neurology® journal is operated under <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://www.neurology.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://www.neurology.org/" target="_blank">neurology.org</a>, branded clearly as the AAN’s journal.<br>
<br>Visual styling is separate and more typical of academic publishing, but there are cross-links back to AAN.com (e.g., navigation mentions AAN membership, benefits).
<br>Content access is tied to AAN membership in some cases (members get full-text access for certain journals).
<br>There is significant Marketing that is one way from AAN to the Neurology Journals but rarely in reverse.
<br>The journal site’s focus is purely research articles, clinical trials, and scientific reviews — no duplication of AAN’s broader professional education, advocacy, or event content.
<br><br>Explanation:<br>
Many public resources — news, events, practice tools, advocacy — are open-access. Member-exclusive content includes guidelines, CME opportunities, and deeper clinical resources. New members are welcomed through clear onboarding steps, including member portals, community forums, and structured orientation emails.<br><br><br>Explanation:<br>
AAN’s primary audience remains clinical neurologists and researchers, which gives it a somewhat professional insider focus. However, the tone is notably friendly, with conversational but authoritative messaging. Patient-facing content is present but secondary.<br><br><br>Scores:<br>

<br>Patient-Facing Tools &amp; Content: ★☆☆☆☆ 
<br>Education: ★★★★★ 
<br>Advocacy: ★★★★☆ 
<br>Explanation:<br>
AAN is strong across education, latest science, and practice support. Member networking is solid but not dominant. Events and practice tools are present but slightly secondary to professional development initiatives.<br>Their home page successful balances multiple initiatives by only showcasing 1 element or just directing them deeper into the site to the content form the home page then showing examples of the each.<br>Donation is very hard to discover on the site.<br><br><br>

 <br><br>Name Spaced and Hyphened approved by Carol<br>
ga-{{ EVENT }}<br><br>
<br>Should we name space by domain?   JACC, ACC, CARIOSMART? or is generic ACC Enough?  completionMay 14, 2025

<br>Answer was No: this wouldn't be needed and we can go with the generic name space of 'ga-'


<br><br>All of these attributes are capturing that the page has convinces a user to start the journey for doing the event/action outlined.<br>To streamline our analytics tagging and reduce the chance of typos when adding event classes to our HTML, we’ve standardized and shortened our attribute names for key user interactions. These classes will be applied to CTA buttons and other interactive elements to help us track and move the needle on our core UX goals.<br><br>Building on our discussion around GA4 360 event‑costs, here’s a turnkey way to spot‑track every key interaction on our refactor projects by scoping on URLs and time windows—no need to enumerate every tag in the ticket. We’ll still capture all our predefined event classes, but only for a limited period on the pages that matter.<br><br><br>
<br>
Target Scope

<br>URLs: List all legacy paths and any newly introduced pages or vanity URLs.<br>



<br>
Pre‑Launch (Baseline)

<br>Through editorial we tag legacy pages today with our standard event classes.
<br>Create the Jira Ticket for
<br>Capture all event hits on those URLs for 8 weeks before the refactor launch.<br>



<br>
Launch + Redesign

<br>Deploy the redesigned section—this may include new page paths and any freshly minted vanity URLs.<br>

<br>Immediately upon launch, update the Jira ticket’s URL list to reflect:

<br>Legacy → redesigned paths<br>

<br>Any new/vanity URLs<br>



<br>Capture all class events on that complete URL set for 8 weeks after launch.<br>



<br>
Analysis &amp; Iteration

<br>Compare equivalent pre‑ vs. post‑launch windows on the same URL set.<br>

<br>If further tweaks are needed, open a new ticket starting at Step 2.<br>

<br>Once goals are met, retire that scoped capture to preserve event volume.<br>



<br><br><br>Summary:<br>
Spot‑track all GA events on ACHD&nbsp;SAP page refactor<br>Description:<br>
Scope:

<br>URL List:

<br>/Education-and-Meetings/Products-and-Resources/ACHDSAP`
<br>[plus any new/vanity URLs]<br>




Data Windows:

<br>Pre‑launch: 2025‑03‑25 → 2025‑05‑19<br>

<br>Launch date: 2025‑05‑20<br>

<br>Post‑launch: 2025‑05‑20 → 2025‑07‑15<br>


Tracking:

<br>Capture all our GA event classes fired on these URLs during each window.<br>


Acceptance Criteria:

<br>Events fire on legacy pages during the pre‑launch window.
<br>Events fire on redesigned &amp; new/vanity pages during the post‑launch window.
<br>Pre vs. post counts are available for apples‑to‑apples comparison.
<br>Ticket closes when analysis is complete or next iteration is opened.

<br>Labels:<br>
UX‑Analytics, GA4‑360, Refactor, ACHD‑SAP<br><br>Let me know if you’d like to tweak the window length (e.g. 6 weeks vs. 8 weeks) or any other detail—otherwise I’ll spin up a Jira template and we can roll this out on our next refactor kickoff.<br>Thanks!<br>

1st Step Setup environment for JOINT DEVELOPEMNT (Ling + ASP Dev )<br>
Establish a working version of all article children types within a local environment that can be referenced<br>
2nd Step JOINT DEVELOPEMNT MEETING (Ling, Matt, Rowena, Jacob, and ASP Dev)<br>
Work through any and all architectural, backend and UI alterations needed to convert all these children renderings into full arches.<br>
Meeting should be roughly 3 hours long. This co-work meeting will expediate all needed conversations and decisions to make this conversion completed.<br>

 <br>How to use Subscription Types in HubSpot. <br>Statements of Truth<br>
<br>Source of record for opt ins are 1CRM
<br>Source of record for the flag of global opt out is HubSpot.
<br>
<br>To send any marketing email you must select a Subscription Type.
<br>On Email Footers Manage Subscriptions = 1CRM Unsubscribe from All = HubSpot.
<br>Email lists are made by the Marketing Communication Table.
<br>Problems<br>
There are not resubscribe flows because not built in 1crm.<br>
The rub is that the subscriptions types show up on the renew page.<br>
1CRM opt-ins do not matching the opt-ins from higher logic. Suggest going into the delta from 1crm and higher logic.  Adding new opt in are a  bit of work because it modifies the "pull" from 1crm to Hubspot.<br>Find a way if we can to suppress the one Subscription Type on the resubscribe.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/1crm/hubspot.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/1CRM/Hubspot.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 Aug 2024 10:53:37 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Front End]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>The Hero Image on the homepage will now support an optional overlay button. This button will be configurable by content editors, allowing them to set the URL, text, style (primary or secondary), and position on the image based on different breakpoints (phone, small tablet, large tablet, and desktop).<br>Scope of the Feature:<br>
<br>If there is no URL and Label included in the configuration of the component the hero image area will not be clickable and the render will not render any button UI.
<br>It is MarComs responsibility to deliver an images in the correct size and dimensions with non critical information in the area where the button will be positioned.

<br>Sizes: 300x350, 600x300,900x300,1200x400
<br>Accepted images are PNG, JPG


<br>You can only choose 1 button position, style, URL, and label for all break points.
<br>The entire area of the Positioning grid will be clickable and cause the button to hover.
<br>The cards part of the feature will also will have their click box expanded to their entire area.
<br>Acceptance Criteria:<br>
<br>Button Configuration Options:

<br>URL: Editors can input the target URL for the button. This URL if empty and the Label is included should default to About-ACC URL
<br>Label: Editors can input the display text for the button.
<br>Style:

<br>Primary Button: Teal blue with white text.
<br>Secondary Button: Light grey with black text.
<br>ACC Brand Button: ACC Blue with white text
<br>ACC Brand Reversed: White with ACC Blue Text


<br>Position:

<br>Options: 'Left', 'Center', and 'Right'.
<br>Position varies depending on the breakpoint (refer to the "Button Position Based on Breakpoint" section below).




<br>Button Position Based on Breakpoint:

<br>Button Positioning Grid:

<br>the Grid inset is 0 0 60px 0 to the full width and eight of the image.
<br>1 rem padding from the edge of its inset image.
<br>The hit area of the image should be the entire area.


<br>Phone:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 4 (height)
<br>Button should size down one step from normal.
<br>Uploaded Size: 300w x 350h
<br>Grid Layout: 1 column x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Regardless of 'Left', 'Center', or 'Right' setting, the button will be centered in the bottom row.




<br>Small Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 2 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 600w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 2 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Large Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 900w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Desktop:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 1200w x 400h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell of the last row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.






<br>Responsive Behavior:

<br>The button's position and size should adjust dynamically based on the device's screen size and aspect ratio.
<br>The button should not overlap important text or imagery unless specified in the design guidelines.<br>
( this will be the responsibility of theMarCom to not place critical information in the art in the areas they selected for the button placement. )


<br>Editor Preview:

<br>Provide a preview in the CMS where editors can see how the button will look on different breakpoints before publishing.


<br>QA Testing Notes:<br>
<br>Test button configuration for all breakpoints.
<br>Validate button positioning aligns with the specified grid layouts.
<br>Verify that styling changes correctly based on editor selection.
<br>Test keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility.

 <br>The process of bulk conversion is a nuanced operation that significantly depends on the scope of the pages being converted. Each bulk conversion task is unique, and while insights and learnings from previous conversions inform the process, it's important to note that a bespoke report is produced after each conversion. This report, presented in an Excel document, is a crucial tool that outlines the User Interface (UI) items within the editorial scope - including Rich Text and Custom Scripts - that require remediation following the conversion. The items are neatly categorized by sheet, each containing the Item ID, URL, and proposed remediation notes. This systematic approach provides a comprehensive view of the areas within the CMS that may need review, adjustments, or those indicating a potential function failure. Typical remediation steps include actions like "let fail," "add classes," "remove," and "replace with components," but this list is not exhaustive. If more complex actions are needed, additional notes may be added for clarity. This meticulous process ensures an efficient and methodical approach to addressing changes and potential issues post-conversion.<br><br>A listing of all pages effected by the conversion<br><br><br>]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\arches\conversion\process\excel\editorial-bulk-change-notice-excel.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:29:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audit of Editorial UI]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Over time, the content areas of our CMS have seen the implementation of various User Interface (UI) solutions. Often grassroots in origin, these Editorially Created UI elements, composed of inline styles, in-page styles, and JavaScript, present considerable maintenance and update challenges.<br>To manage this tech debt, our bulk conversion process aims to remediate or remove these elements. The goal is to align our UI with the Arches Enterprise Design System, which entails eliminating non-conforming in-page JavaScript and Styles.<br>To facilitate this, we're conducting an audit of the Editorially Created UI components. This audit plays a crucial role in forming a plan that ensures website functionality while addressing unnecessary complexity.<br><br>This process involves a meticulous examination and subsequent remediation of all editorially integrated links - a prerequisite before launching any audit. Our audit also thoroughly reviews content areas embedded with script and style blocks. Particular attention is given to the returned content scrape, which is systematically converted into a Unicode format that's safe for coding.<br>As part of this procedure, we identify and replace certain patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their equivalent symbols, and transform specific HTML entity codes into spaces and carriage returns, thereby improving block readability. This method allows the team to evaluate readable blocks effectively and discover any "new" patterns, which aids in documenting necessary remediation steps. This systematic approach prepares us for the eventual removal of style and script blocks, creating the necessary tickets or steps as required.<br>Numbered Steps:<br>
<br>Begin by running the remediation of all editorially included links that are set to "Save" before initiating the audit.
<br>Perform an <a data-href="#Audit Report" href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\about:blank#Audit_Report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Audit Report</a> of content areas that contain script and style blocks on the page.
<br>Ensure the returned content scrap is converted into a code-safe Unicode because of the <a data-href="#Content Scrape Limitations" href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\about:blank#Content_Scrape_Limitations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Content Scrape Limitations</a>.
<br>Identify and replace specific patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their corresponding symbols.
<br>Substitute certain HTML entity codes into space and transform others into carriage returns.
<br>Evaluate the now readable blocks after the aforementioned transformations.
<br>Discover any new patterns that emerge from the evaluation, and document the appropriate <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Remediation" data-href="Remediation" href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\arches\conversion\process\excel\remediation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">remediation steps</a>.
<br>Finally, create any necessary tickets or steps to prepare for the obliteration of style and script blocks.
<br><br><br><br>To make the code more readable, it's crucial to replace certain Unicode characters with their typical representations. Specifically, we'll be dealing with the following conversions:<br>
<br>The Unicode for the carriage return, _000D_, should be replaced with a visual marker for carriage returns such as the symbol "↵".
<br>The Unicode for the horizontal tab, _0009_, could be replaced with a few spaces for better visualization.
<br>The Unicode for the space, _0020_, can be substituted with a visible space character.
<br>The line feed character, represented by the Unicode _000A_, can be swapped with a new line symbol like "␤" to depict line breaks better.
<br>The tab character, also represented by _0009_, should be replaced with a few spaces for clarity.
<br>Finally, the Unicode for less than and greater than symbols, &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;, can be converted to their actual "&lt;" and "&gt;" symbols.
<br>By transforming these Unicode characters into their corresponding visual representations, we significantly enhance the comprehensibility of the document, thus facilitating easier identification of different elements and their spacing.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\arches\conversion\process\excel\audit-of-editorial-ui.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Audit of Editorial UI.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:29:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Scripts]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Auditing Query Scripts: These scripts function as digital scanners for the area specified in the bulk conversion. They produce various reports that aid in devising action plans, drafting reports, and even targeting actionable needs for Jira tickets. 
<br>Action Scripts: This category represents a comprehensive collection of automations. These scripts interact directly with different parts of our system, such as the codebase, the CMS, or the content within the CMS. They perform a broad array of tasks, which can include automatic adjustments, content updates &amp; alterations, or system configuration alterations.

<br>Option 1: Set content items to a DRAFT status when converting content in Author.&nbsp; See Sitecore DRAFT workflow doc&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Possible risk is the Original Posted Date may be updated as a result (need confirmation)&nbsp;
<br>Option 2: -- TBD&nbsp;


<br>
IT to perform spot checks in Author to ensure the conversion script was completed successfully.&nbsp;

<br>
BL reviews converted pages in Author and as pages are validated, publish in increments (as appropriate)&nbsp;

<br>UI, DEV, &amp; QA teams on standby to field any questions or address any concerns&nbsp;




<br>
Post Conversion/Clean Up Tasks&nbsp;(once all batches are complete, one-time task)&nbsp;

<br>Once conversion is complete, we will take the Arches presentations and merge them into the current legacy template presentation configurations, and delete the Arches versions, as clean up.&nbsp;


<br>QA Approach (DRAFT)&nbsp;<br>NOTE: This approach should be visited as we progress w/ the batches.&nbsp; Also, scheduled sprint content syncs should not adversely affect the Arches QA pages since they will already exist prior to the content sync.&nbsp;<br>
<br>UI/UX team will create an Arches QA dedicated page (e.g., page name to include '_ArchesQA' suffix&nbsp; in the DEV environment in support of their development &amp; verification process.&nbsp;
<br>Once the component updates have been verified in the DEV environment, UI/UX to request a Razl content sync to SPR in coordination w/ their updates getting built and deployed to SPR. (Ricky can assist w/ Razl syncs)&nbsp;
<br>QA will then use the Arches QA dedicated page in SPR to test the target components.&nbsp; Once validated in SPR, QA will work with DEV (Ricky) to sync content to upper environments (STG/RLS) as the changes are promoted.&nbsp;
<br>PRD deployment (e.g., pre-task) should include a step to sync the Arches QA dedicated page to PRD (Author ONLY, do not publish to Delivery) in order for QA validate in PRD.&nbsp;
<br>Once validated, need to ensure there is a clean-up process to remove/delete QA dedicated pages, once ready (in ALL environments)&nbsp;
<br>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It is important that we have a way to roll back our work at any point throughout these cycles and we need to be able to do this in a way that BL can be comfortable with. This plan doesn’t really account for if something goes pear shaped in Sprint C but we should probably iron that out as well, especially if something goes wrong during the push to production.&nbsp;<br>This looks like a three-sprint process, but we may be able to consider identifying the next batch during sprint C to speed up conversion if necessary.<br><a href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump?query=tag:acc\arches" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/arches</a> <a href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump?query=tag:acc\arches\conversion" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/arches/conversion</a> <a href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump?query=tag:acc\guidance" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/guidance</a> <br>Metadata

 <br>&nbsp;I want to outline a comprehensive Knowledge Transfer (KT) strategy that targets the required remediation steps. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition, allowing our team to manage the work systematically and avoid overwhelming our team resources and capabilities.&nbsp;<br>Here's a step-by-step process to guide our KT activities:<br>Sub-dividing the Conversion into Manageable Segments:&nbsp;We can accomplish tasks efficiently throughout the week by dividing the bulk conversion into themed work or manageable segments. For instance, focusing on a specific aspect like "all the pages that have tabs" will make the process more digestible and actionable.<br>Weekly Kick-off Meeting for Conversion Blocks:&nbsp;At the start of the week, we will convene a meeting where a conversion block of pages is presented. This meeting will include a live demo showing how to make the necessary changes, providing an excellent opportunity for team members to understand the process firsthand.<br>Standing 30-Minute Meetings throughout the Week:&nbsp;To ensure continuous support and clear communication, I suggest scheduling a standing 30-minute meeting every day. This stand-up meeting will be a forum to discuss any roadblocks or questions related to the assigned work. It will enable real-time problem-solving and maintain momentum in the project.<br>Here’s a high-level schedule to illustrate the flow:<br>Monday:&nbsp;Kick-off meeting with a conversion demo for the week's segment (e.g., pages with tabs).<br>Tuesday to Friday:&nbsp;Daily 30-minute stand-up sessions to address questions and roadblocks.<br>End of Week:&nbsp;Recap and assessment of the week's accomplishments, planning for the next segment.<br>By adhering to this process, we aim to create a structured approach to knowledge transfer, facilitating the handling complex conversion tasks and empowering our team with the confidence and competence needed.  <br>Also, it's worth mentioning that our KT process is designed to be flexible and responsive to the team's evolving needs. As our collective experience and proficiency grow, we anticipate that the demand and duration of the daily stand-up meetings may not be needed or shortened. We'll continually assess the progress and adjust accordingly, ensuring our approach remains efficient and aligned with the team's capabilities. Continued feedback will be instrumental in this ongoing refinement, keeping us agile and focused on our shared goals.  <br><br>ACC User Experience Team&nbsp;<br>American College of Cardiology<br>2400 N Street NW<br>Washington DC, 20037<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="render:///www.acc.org" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href=".\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\render:\\www.acc.org" target="_blank">www.acc.org</a>]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\arches\conversion\editorial-training\kt-sessions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Editorial training/KT SESSIONS.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:29:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Phase 2]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>Considering the difficulties that editors encounter in distinguishing between legacy, converted, and legacy supportive components, owing to the absence of folder structure and clear naming, we've introduced a streamlined approach. All component icons are now set to grey or red by default. However, converted and supportive components, along with the majority of new work, will be marked with either blue icons for compatible renderings or green for new arches components. This blue color is intended to be the default setting both arches and legacy supportive components. It's essential for the development team to review and ensure this default setting when releasing new work into the platform. In any instance where the blue green or grey is not the icon for the rending, the setting must be promptly corrected.<br>
Further Icon Definition allow for even easier recognition in the back end will be. Page Layout components should be Starts, Vue/JavaScript driven components should be puzzle pieces.  <br><br>When looking at the display view list in the backend you only see the render name and its relative location that it is placed in the list. As the teams move forward in using more and more shared content and breaking down content into chunks the Display view gets rather unuable becuase you would see RichText written possilbly 5 times on the page the same is true with accordions. In that view is it possible to interject at least the details of the source which can be altered with a nickname like intro-text, benifit grid.....<br><br>The component dependency tree outlines the interrelationships between components in a Sitecore instance, specifically identifying those that are either children of a component or have dependent child components. Only necessary components should be configured in this instance to maintain simplicity and reduce confusion for editors. This approach also minimizes the risk of including non-supportive components by lessening the need for editors to manually add components. Ultimately, this method aids in preventing the appearance of non-supportive components within converted pages, ensuring a clean and efficient working environment.]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\arches\conversion\components\quality-of-life-configurations-with-sitecore.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Components/Quality of life configurations with Sitecore.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:29:42 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating A New ACC.org Component]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Better answer is to wrap the responsive features<br>
Grid, columns, rows, display, flex direction, align, padding, margin, max—w and width.  Col-start col-end row-start &amp; row-end.<br>
In their own stylesheet for now and load it after the CSS of UC.css<br>
.ContainerQuery:Wrapper{}<br>

 <br>Frontend development continues to expand as a percentage of project coding to the point that some of our products, such as the clinical applications, are 100% frontend code. Over the past year, I have been putting work together to support a massive shift in how we do frontend and, in the long run, how we develop, support, and release our college software solutions.&nbsp;<br>The most significant issue I continually see in IT is decentralized coding efforts. Decentralization leads to repetitive solutions, inconsistent behaviors, extended regression testing, bloated packages, complicated deployments, and potential code errors as we try to make security patches or upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Focusing on improving how we execute frontend for the college and not just for a project, I have tackled four pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>Unification of design but building for flexibility
<br>Shifting to the CFD (component first development )
<br>Creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored
<br>Centralizing everything for everyone
<br>The unification of design was the first place I started. "Arches" is the current solution that enforces a Design Opps procedure to streamline requests and deliver a college-wide design system. This design system has two tenants. First, it can replicate its styles influenced by the brand and frameworks from its product space. It now covers QII, ACC, Cardiosmart, and Mobile and can be further scaled. Second is its utility framework that ensures a highly flexible practice to allow countless UI permutations without CSS mutations. Utility styling is also known as "scopeless" styling because you can build out many UI patterns without ever altering the original styles.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/" target="_blank">https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/</a><br>Shifting to CFD (component first development) embraces an architecture for our frontend products and alters how we develop. CFD, as a pattern, has been around since 2012 with bootstrap. In its infancy, CFD could only capture minor token UI. Still, with the introduction of javascript models like Web Components, React, Vue CFD can now capture business logic, complicated interface interactions, and data mutations. Vue has been my primary focus as it builds on the collective knowledge of the department. Vue has the capabilities to make obsolete Jquery UI, Pager, Knockout, Angular, JqueryMobile, and many other libraries that are currently in use. IT streamlining to a single dependency allows for universal software patching for frontend security issues.&nbsp;<br>Currently, we are creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored. As we shift to CFD, we can use Storybook which allows for documentation around a living singular component with artificial data. This type of documentation gives a single point of Design, Development, and QA. The effort on a single element can be attached to countless projects through version control. Centralized development and QA can give us a feasible path to automated unit testing and regression testing. As new projects come online, utilizing the global-version-controlled components would benefit from standards, consistency, and quality control. Preliminary work done with Storybook around a future product under the ACC.org "Home Page Redesign." Projects could include the transcript, CSTool, GL Search, Coveo Search, and FIT Management. <br>Vue 2 component for reference<br>

I have conversations  GM, Josh G, and Micheal M, and the great work of Ling C on creating a path forward with using assets.acc.org and also moving the newly used submodule features from GIT  within current and future products. Submodules empower the component work to be checked in and out from both the centralized-version-control and from projects, these efforts can be kept in sync. The vision for this project is to be controlled by ACC but utilizable by vendors.  ]]></description><link>.\https:\\acc-style.github.io\BrainDump\work\acc\arches\front-end-design-at-the-college.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Front End Design at the College.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 13:29:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Arches]]></title><description><![CDATA[
