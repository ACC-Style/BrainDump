 <br>Here are all four personas, incorporating the updated preferences:<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Emma Wright  

<br>
Demographics: 42, Cardiologist, Busy Practitioner  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
Emma frequently visits the member section but rarely interacts. She uses the platform to gain exposure to new ideas and practices outside the confines of her immediate professional environment. Though she doesn't contribute to discussions, she values the ability to access diverse perspectives and knowledge that she might not encounter in her day-to-day practice.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Access to a broader range of insights and innovations outside her specialized work environment  
<br>Exposure to emerging trends and interdisciplinary practices without the pressure to engage  
<br>Staying up-to-date on best practices in cardiovascular care across a wide professional spectrum


<br>
Frustrations:

<br>Encouraging passive participation through features like recommended reading based on emerging trends  
<br>Exposure to discussions and webinars that broaden her view outside her regular practice area


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: David Chen  

<br>
Demographics: 34, Nurse Practitioner, Cardiovascular Specialty  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
David sees the member section as a much-needed space where he can connect with like-minded professionals who share his focus on cardiovascular care. In his current professional environment, he often feels isolated due to the niche nature of his specialty. The member section provides him with a sense of belonging, allowing him to engage in meaningful discussions, contribute his expertise, and exchange ideas with others who understand his field.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Building connections with professionals who share his specialty and interests  
<br>Participating in discussions and sharing his experiences to contribute to the collective knowledge of his "tribe"  
<br>Seeking out a supportive community that is not readily available in his current work environment


<br>
Frustrations:  

<br>Lacks opportunities for collaboration and shared experiences within his immediate workplace  
<br>Difficulty finding deeper engagement in discussions that go beyond surface-level topics


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Dedicated spaces or groups within the platform that focus specifically on his specialty, fostering a "tribe" mentality  
<br>Opportunities for collaboration on case studies or joint projects with other specialists  
<br>Recognition for contributing to niche discussions, further building a sense of community and validation


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Lisa Patel  

<br>
Demographics: 48, Physician Assistant, Balancing Multiple Roles  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
Lisa uses the member section to break free from the professional silos of her work. When she engages, she actively seeks out networking opportunities with peers from diverse backgrounds. These connections help her gain insights and ideas outside the boundaries of her current professional setting. Her engagement comes in bursts, focused primarily on meeting new people and exchanging knowledge.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Networking with professionals from various specialties to broaden her perspective  
<br>Engaging with peers to exchange innovative ideas and learn from different fields  
<br>Building relationships that provide exposure to new methods, outside of her regular clinical environment


<br>
Frustrations:  

<br>Difficulty maintaining new contacts and finding ongoing opportunities to interact  
<br>Feels her access to new ideas is limited during inactive periods, making her engagement feel sporadic and siloed


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Networking events or peer-matching features that introduce her to professionals from outside her usual circles  
<br>Opportunities to connect with members who share interdisciplinary expertise and experiences  
<br>Features to maintain relationships, such as saved connections or discussion prompts that encourage ongoing dialogue


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Dr. Marcus Johnson  

<br>
Demographics: 55, Senior Cardiologist, Thought Leader  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Helping guide the direction of the section to better serve the community

Frustrations:  

<br>Limited ability to influence strategic decisions about the section’s development  
<br>Lacks advanced tools for proposing or implementing changes to the website structure and content curation


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Opportunities to join advisory boards or task forces that influence the site’s growth and development

Before I start this, I want to ask you to "love this for 5 minutes," then you can react.<br>In the act of working with clients, we often take the content documents we are offered, and our reaction to doing IA is to take that content and shoehorn it into UI to satisfy the client.<br><br>For years and possibly decades, I have taken content documents and shaved off a word or two. However, I have come to realize the immense detriment I have been doing to the strategic approach to content creation by skipping to the UI answer. Instead of merely using 'Styled UI' to reshape, mutate, and hide content, we should focus on enhancing the content to bolster the user experience by solving the underlying issues that users might face with the content that was initially delivered.<br><br>I have a different opinion on why we shouldn't create wireframes this early in a project. For the sake of speed, we, myself included, often skip the IA step, rushing to return to the client with wireframes. We then cleverly force their content into blocks and hidden areas on the page. The downside of internalizing the IA within the team and applying layouts and UI to content is that it directs our conversations with business lines toward solutions, rather than focusing on improving the content on the site. This undermines the value that IA discussions can bring. Jumping straight to UI wires limits our ability to challenge how we receive and refine raw content. We should at least help them transform it before we start applying UI.<br>I want to ensure there is a moment when clients are encouraged and guided to evaluate the provided content. Content strategists can have the greatest impact by unlocking the potential for more effective and engaging content.<br><br>Here is an example of what happens when we skip straight to UI. The wireframes react to the content as it is provided. In the team's review of overwhelming content, we responded by using accordions in the UI to hide excess information. This was a superficial fix that masked the issue—that the content was too lengthy and not concise. No changes were made to the content itself because we had already hidden it.<br>Now we have introduced a situation where our users are forced into a discovery mode, and we haven't solved the problem that the content was too much or not aligned with the actual goals of the page.<br><br>To maximize the effectiveness of content, we need to change our approach. Instead of rushing into UI design, we should follow a structured process:<br>
<br>Content Evaluation: Review the content before doing any design work. Understand the purpose of the content and whether it aligns with the project's goals.
<br>Information Architecture (IA) Application: Use IA to refine, organize, and simplify the content into a logical structure. Ensure that the content is easily navigable and user-friendly.
<br>Content Transformation: Apply appropriate hierarchies and organize the text logically. If necessary, split the content across multiple pages to make it more digestible.

<br>This should be a word document
<br>You can outline that content is either series on the page or is in parallel.
<br>Should denote page breaks and how it is wired between pages.


<br>Content Presentation: Share the revised content with the client. Encourage them to review it in a Word document format so they can engage with the material and provide feedback.
<br>Content Refinement: Based on client feedback, refine the content further. Make sure it is concise, clear, and aligned with the project’s objectives.
<br>UI Design: Only after finalizing the content should we begin designing the UI. At this stage, the content will be well-organized, aligned with user goals, and ready to be integrated into the page layout.
<br>By following these steps, we ensure that the content drives the design, not the other way around. This structured approach leads to better user experiences and more effective communication.<br>
<br>Where does this go?
<br>Should this be another page?
<br>What is this content saying?
<br>Should we hide this from the user?
<br>What is the point of this page?
<br>What are the goals, and does this content support them?
<br>Let’s encourage our clients to review the content in a Word document. It’s important for them to read through the information and share their thoughts. This step is crucial to ensure that the content matches the project’s goals and is easy for users to understand. As content strategists, we should lead this conversation by presenting our findings and showing our dedication to delivering top-quality content.<br>Only when we have finalized the content can we move on to page designs and work on the UI.]]></description><link>work/acc/thoughts/not-using-ui-but-word-documents.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Thoughts/Not Using UI but Word Documents.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:18:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[CardioSmart 2025 UX]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>
<br>Ensure the site provides immediate feedback for user actions, such as logging in, submitting forms, or loading pages, so users know their actions are being processed.
<br><br>
<br>The content and navigation should use terms and language that resonate with your audience (e.g., "My Courses," "Membership Dashboard," "Explore Articles") to make the site intuitive.
<br><br>
<br>Users should be able to easily navigate between sections, undo actions, and go back without confusion, especially when managing membership details or course enrollments.
<br><br>
<br>The design, layout, and labeling should remain consistent across the site, whether users are in the membership area, reading articles, or accessing educational content.
<br><br>
<br>Provide users with clear, guided steps to minimize mistakes, particularly in processes like signing up for a membership, enrolling in a course, or making a purchase.
<br><br>
<br>Reduce the need for users to remember details by displaying key information clearly, such as membership status, progress in courses, and recommended articles.
<br><br>
<br>Design for both new and experienced users, allowing shortcuts and advanced features (like filtering or bookmarking) for members who visit frequently while keeping it simple for new visitors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that pages are visually simple and easy to navigate, focusing on the most important actions like reading articles, accessing courses, or checking membership benefits.
<br><br>
<br>If something goes wrong, provide a clear explanation and actionable steps to resolve the issue, such as payment problems or content loading errors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that users can quickly find help through FAQs, support articles, or a contact option, especially when they are having trouble with their membership, accessing courses, or reading content.

 <br>Editorial team makes use of a Show/Hide UI feature frequently. As part of the Arches conversion, the individual instances of this will be stripped. We need to rebuild this functionality in a way that makes it easy for editors to add these expand/collapse blocks.&nbsp;<br>Attached is a version of the current code for reference.<br>
`<br>
&lt;script language="javascript" type="text/javascript"&gt;

   function showHide(shID) {

<br>
Identify a batch of pages as the upcoming candidate batch for conversion. Considerations:&nbsp;

<br>Can we target a good number of pages with the same component composition (they use the same components exclusively)? This lets us control variables.&nbsp;
<br>Provide a list of the components to UI for conversion.&nbsp;
<br>Confirm the batch with any interested parties if relevant (editorial, BL, users, etc etc)&nbsp;


<br>
UI analyzes component list conversion and provides LOE.&nbsp;

<br>How complex will the conversions be/How long will it take? Generally, this will hopefully be doable in one sprint assuming there is not any major rebuilding needed. Most importantly we need to determine how many will need to be rebuilt completely.&nbsp;

<br>Create tickets for each component up for conversion (we may be able to lump some lighter ones together, we can decide that after analysis).&nbsp;


<br>
Groom, add to schedule, etc.&nbsp;

<br><br>
<br>
UI team completes component conversion tickets.&nbsp;

<br>
QA tests converted components on sample pages in test environments.&nbsp; 

<br>
Push conversions to production,&nbsp;including deployments steps to make sure the components are available for use on all environments.&nbsp;

<br>
UI provides list of bulk changes, including&nbsp;

<br>Components that need to be switched to an Arches version in presentation layout.&nbsp;
<br>If applicable, a list of changes to rich text content where the change can realistically be done with a bulk script (i.e., search and replace)&nbsp;
<br>A list of issues from conversion that will need manual intervention.&nbsp;
<br><a data-href="New Component" href="work/acc/arches/conversion/new-component.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">New Component</a>

3. Run Clean Up scripts across  Richtext and CustomScript Sitecore components
<br><br>
<br>
Development creates scripts to process changes provided by UI in Sprint B.&nbsp;

<br>Precondition: Components that need to be switched to Arches has already been developed, tested,&nbsp; and pushed to ALL environments (DEV, SPR, STG, RLS, PRD)&nbsp;


<br>
Run script in development environment for specific pages that apply to this batch (i.e., #1) and verify.&nbsp;

<br>
Review affected pages for discrepancies/bugs for resolution (e.g., code, components, etc.)&nbsp;

<br>If code changes are required, create JIRA tickets for upcoming sprint.&nbsp; Sprint C will be paused until these code changes are made in ALL environment&nbsp;


<br>
Review and identify any content issues (rich text, custom scripts) and work w/ BL on resolution&nbsp;



<br>
Run clean up script to identify problematic scripts that need to be&nbsp;remediated&nbsp;(<a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://support.acc.org/browse/AWC-3942" target="_blank">https://support.acc.org/browse/AWC-3942</a>) and push to environments accordingly.&nbsp;

<br>
Promote to other lower environments (SPR, STG, RLS) and validate in each environment accordingly.&nbsp;

<br>Perform demo for BL to review results of bulk conversion for batch in scope (STG or RLS) and obtain sign-off&nbsp;


<br>
Create a PRD back-up to support a rollback, if needed (requires further discussion around specific rollback tasks/steps)&nbsp;

<br>Take back-ups of both&nbsp;Author and Web DBs&nbsp;
<br>Need to enforce a&nbsp;content freeze&nbsp;(BL), specifically for a&nbsp;subset of pages/content&nbsp;


<br>
Promote to PRD and run bulk conversion script in Author ONLY, do NOT publish to Delivery.&nbsp;

<br>
IMPORTANT NOTE: To ensure content is NOT auto-published, there is a need to explore options.&nbsp;

<br>Option 1: Set content items to a DRAFT status when converting content in Author.&nbsp; See Sitecore DRAFT workflow doc&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Possible risk is the Original Posted Date may be updated as a result (need confirmation)&nbsp;
<br>Option 2: -- TBD&nbsp;


<br>
IT to perform spot checks in Author to ensure the conversion script was completed successfully.&nbsp;

<br>
BL reviews converted pages in Author and as pages are validated, publish in increments (as appropriate)&nbsp;

<br>UI, DEV, &amp; QA teams on standby to field any questions or address any concerns&nbsp;




<br>
Post Conversion/Clean Up Tasks&nbsp;(once all batches are complete, one-time task)&nbsp;

<br>Once conversion is complete, we will take the Arches presentations and merge them into the current legacy template presentation configurations, and delete the Arches versions, as clean up.&nbsp;


<br>QA Approach (DRAFT)&nbsp;<br>NOTE: This approach should be visited as we progress w/ the batches.&nbsp; Also, scheduled sprint content syncs should not adversely affect the Arches QA pages since they will already exist prior to the content sync.&nbsp;<br>
<br>UI/UX team will create an Arches QA dedicated page (e.g., page name to include '_ArchesQA' suffix&nbsp; in the DEV environment in support of their development &amp; verification process.&nbsp;
<br>Once the component updates have been verified in the DEV environment, UI/UX to request a Razl content sync to SPR in coordination w/ their updates getting built and deployed to SPR. (Ricky can assist w/ Razl syncs)&nbsp;
<br>QA will then use the Arches QA dedicated page in SPR to test the target components.&nbsp; Once validated in SPR, QA will work with DEV (Ricky) to sync content to upper environments (STG/RLS) as the changes are promoted.&nbsp;
<br>PRD deployment (e.g., pre-task) should include a step to sync the Arches QA dedicated page to PRD (Author ONLY, do not publish to Delivery) in order for QA validate in PRD.&nbsp;
<br>Once validated, need to ensure there is a clean-up process to remove/delete QA dedicated pages, once ready (in ALL environments)&nbsp;
<br>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It is important that we have a way to roll back our work at any point throughout these cycles and we need to be able to do this in a way that BL can be comfortable with. This plan doesn’t really account for if something goes pear shaped in Sprint C but we should probably iron that out as well, especially if something goes wrong during the push to production.&nbsp;<br>This looks like a three-sprint process, but we may be able to consider identifying the next batch during sprint C to speed up conversion if necessary.<br><a href=".?query=tag:acc/arches" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/arches</a> <a href=".?query=tag:acc/arches/conversion" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/arches/conversion</a> <a href=".?query=tag:acc/guidance" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/guidance</a> <br>Metadata

 <br>Backlog Ticket: Article "Children Renderings" Conversion to Arches<br>
<br>
Title: Convert Article Subtypes to Arches Format

<br>
Description:

<br>Background: Currently, the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes are not compatible with our ARCHES system. These subtypes include ClinicalTrial, GuidelineHub, JournalScan, PressRelease, Recommendation, TenPoints, and potentially others not listed.
<br>Objective: To successfully convert the "children renderings" of articles into the ARCHES format, ensuring seamless integration with the CMS and maintaining consistency across ACC platforms.
<br>User Story: As a developer, I want to convert the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes into the ARCHES format, so that articles can be more efficiently managed and displayed across ACC's digital platforms.


<br>
Acceptance Criteria:

<br>A working version of all article children types is established in a local environment.
<br>The conversion of all identified children renderings into the ARCHES format is completed.
<br>Ensure that the new ARCHES renderings are fully functional and compatible with existing CMS infrastructure.
<br>Maintain visual and functional consistency with the overall design and layout standards of ACC platforms.
<br>The conversion process and final output should be documented for future reference and maintenance.
<br>The conversion should be completed without causing any downtime or disruption to live services.


<br>
Dependencies: 

<br>The ticket depends on the successful setup of a local development environment for the joint development effort.
<br>This ticket blocks the work for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" target="_blank">APPSUPPORT-22095</a>.
<br>Coordination with the team members (Ling, Matt, Rowena, Jacob, and ASP Dev) for a 3-hour joint development meeting is crucial.


<br>
Notes for Joint Development Meeting:

<br>Confirm attendance and availability of all required team members.
<br>Ensure all necessary tools and resources are accessible during the meeting.
<br>Set clear objectives for the meeting to maximize productivity.
<br>Allocate time for discussion, development, and troubleshooting.

 <br><br>
<br>Hard to find
<br>Slow to load
<br>Not up to date
<br>Login 
<br>Product Life Cycle from a user point of view (buy, use, renew, extract credits)
<br><br>
<br>How useful is the Main Nav (Clinical Topics)
<br>Latest in Cardiology (Doesn't Mean anything it is a junk drawer)
<br>how useful is  Search on Site if everyone is using google
<br>Lack of enforcement of member value with out pay wall. 
<br>Personalization - Give value to login in!!!!
<br>Content is written a dated and not directed way when dealing with brochureware, products any that is not science

<br>We speak to everyone which means our voice is not compelling to anyone.


<br>Not Mobile Friendly
<br>Duplicative Content (Confusing for users and a drain on resources)

<br>Articles, Content, Products, and Derivatives
<br>Confusing "Like" Products.

<br>CCKE
<br>Webinar vs Online Course
<br>Key Points vs Top Ten
<br>ASCVD RISK (Apps, Excel, CardioSmart HHRC, tools.acc.org )




<br>Not Accessible 

<br>Structure Aria
<br>Brand Color Issues
<br>Image Usage with Text
<br>SEM/SEO
<br>Find-ability
<br>Promotion
<br>STRUCTURED Data &amp; Content
<br>Analytics Funneling


<br>No clear division between Enterprise Domains.

<br>Clear Usage, Focus of Efforts, Reasons to Deploy within each Domain. 

<br>Why should something be found in JACC and not ACC or CardioSmart. 




<br>Central Login with our Family of Products. 

<br>Cross walking our Enterprise is a jarring. 


<br>No structural plans for how to scale content onto the site. 
<br>Disjointed implementation of Design. (Lack of Creative Direction Enforcement) 

<br>Need ACC to have enough built out so we don't run into "it needs to be NEW UI"
<br>Need a process to "Accept new UI"
<br>Need to know who and what is being built so we can police it. (UX and CS)
<br>Need the power to enforce. We can be overruled.


<br>Maintenance Issue (slow to fix, slow to change)

<br>Resources limitations causes errors and fixes to languish for weeks to even years.

<br>Grid Box Error
<br>Membership Section Announcements
<br>SWG improvements
<br>Arches Conversion
<br>Forsee errors should make a jira hot fix.




<br>Pain Points are training users to alter their behavior. 

<br>Mobile is painful so they use desktops
<br>Purchased Product Entry Points are hard to find so users go back to the original purchase page
<br>Nothing changes when I login so why should I.
<br>Science is hard to find so they go somewhere else....


<br>Load Times

<br>Optimization of Code, Loaded Content to Page, Slow to Paint Page.  

<br>Still looking at 4-6 seconds to load official standard of the web is .1




<br>Back End Editing is Painful

<br>Components are hard to find, organization is confused and mixed with legacy and arches and never use.
<br>Components need a combination of Experience Editor and Detail View
<br>SiteCore likes to alter and "lint" html between Source and WYSIWYG
<br>I don't know if this is a sitecore problem or an us problem.


<br>No real way to test (from a base setup)

<br>A/B
<br>Funnel Tracking 


<br>We have branching pages that give no value besides wiring the pages together
<br>Orphan Pages from the site experience
<br>FIX All Foresee Bugs
<br>Phase 2 and Maintenance is a Unicorn.
<br>Out of the list above what is a Content, Design, Process, Technical issues?<br><br><br>
<br>A|B Testing with content and design
<br>Back End/ Editing
<br>Loading Times
<br>Dev Time
<br>Personalization

<br>Duplicative
<br>Writing Style
<br>Accessibility
<br><br>
<br>Personalization
<br>Member Benefits
<br>Guided Experience based on Purchase Life Cycle.
<br><br>
<br>Changes are are jarring
<br>Consistency is good
<br>New experience is always hated by someone
<br>What is the scope of the Redesign. Are we just starting over? are we keeping with best patterns and applying consistency? Are we just removing the dead weight and fixing problems?
<br><br>
<br>Duplicity
<br>SEO/SEM
<br><br>
<br>interviews with staff (member care, IT, etc.)
<br>MI surveys
<br>Foresee
<br>interviews with non member users
<br><br>Change management historically is weak at the ACC<br>
<br>Silos are real and we are not a flat organization!
<br>Push back from Silos, Stakeholders, Members
<br>Traditions are hard to break
<br>ACC is not an enforcer - how you need to work

There are not resubscribe flows because not built in 1crm.<br>
The rub is that the subscriptions types show up on the renew page.<br>
1CRM opt-ins do not matching the opt-ins from higher logic. Suggest going into the delta from 1crm and higher logic.

 <br><br><br>Considering the difficulties that editors encounter in distinguishing between legacy, converted, and legacy supportive components, owing to the absence of folder structure and clear naming, we've introduced a streamlined approach. All component icons are now set to grey by default. However, converted and supportive components, along with the majority of new work, will be marked with blue icons. This blue color is intended to be the default setting for new icons and for those converted or supportive components. It's essential for the development team to review and ensure this default setting. In any instance where the blue is not the default for these components, the setting must be promptly corrected.<br><br>The component dependency tree outlines the interrelationships between components in a Sitecore instance, specifically identifying those that are either children of a component or have dependent child components. Only necessary components should be configured in this instance to maintain simplicity and reduce confusion for editors. This approach also minimizes the risk of including non-supportive components by lessening the need for editors to manually add components. Ultimately, this method aids in preventing the appearance of non-supportive components within converted pages, ensuring a clean and efficient working environment.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/components/quality-of-life-configurations-with-sitecore.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Components/Quality of life configurations with Sitecore.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jul 2023 18:38:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[experience editor]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>&nbsp;I want to outline a comprehensive Knowledge Transfer (KT) strategy that targets the required remediation steps. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition, allowing our team to manage the work systematically and avoid overwhelming our team resources and capabilities.&nbsp;<br>Here's a step-by-step process to guide our KT activities:<br>Sub-dividing the Conversion into Manageable Segments:&nbsp;We can accomplish tasks efficiently throughout the week by dividing the bulk conversion into themed work or manageable segments. For instance, focusing on a specific aspect like "all the pages that have tabs" will make the process more digestible and actionable.<br>Weekly Kick-off Meeting for Conversion Blocks:&nbsp;At the start of the week, we will convene a meeting where a conversion block of pages is presented. This meeting will include a live demo showing how to make the necessary changes, providing an excellent opportunity for team members to understand the process firsthand.<br>Standing 30-Minute Meetings throughout the Week:&nbsp;To ensure continuous support and clear communication, I suggest scheduling a standing 30-minute meeting every day. This stand-up meeting will be a forum to discuss any roadblocks or questions related to the assigned work. It will enable real-time problem-solving and maintain momentum in the project.<br>Here’s a high-level schedule to illustrate the flow:<br>Monday:&nbsp;Kick-off meeting with a conversion demo for the week's segment (e.g., pages with tabs).<br>Tuesday to Friday:&nbsp;Daily 30-minute stand-up sessions to address questions and roadblocks.<br>End of Week:&nbsp;Recap and assessment of the week's accomplishments, planning for the next segment.<br>By adhering to this process, we aim to create a structured approach to knowledge transfer, facilitating the handling complex conversion tasks and empowering our team with the confidence and competence needed.  <br>Also, it's worth mentioning that our KT process is designed to be flexible and responsive to the team's evolving needs. As our collective experience and proficiency grow, we anticipate that the demand and duration of the daily stand-up meetings may not be needed or shortened. We'll continually assess the progress and adjust accordingly, ensuring our approach remains efficient and aligned with the team's capabilities. Continued feedback will be instrumental in this ongoing refinement, keeping us agile and focused on our shared goals.  <br><br>ACC User Experience Team&nbsp;<br>American College of Cardiology<br>2400 N Street NW<br>Washington DC, 20037<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="render:///www.acc.org" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/render://www.acc.org" target="_blank">www.acc.org</a>]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/kt-sessions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Editorial training/KT SESSIONS.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 19:25:05 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Phase 1]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Over time, the content areas of our CMS have seen the implementation of various User Interface (UI) solutions. Often grassroots in origin, these Editorially Created UI elements, composed of inline styles, in-page styles, and JavaScript, present considerable maintenance and update challenges.<br>To manage this tech debt, our bulk conversion process aims to remediate or remove these elements. The goal is to align our UI with the Arches Enterprise Design System, which entails eliminating non-conforming in-page JavaScript and Styles.<br>To facilitate this, we're conducting an audit of the Editorially Created UI components. This audit plays a crucial role in forming a plan that ensures website functionality while addressing unnecessary complexity.<br><br>This process involves a meticulous examination and subsequent remediation of all editorially integrated links - a prerequisite before launching any audit. Our audit also thoroughly reviews content areas embedded with script and style blocks. Particular attention is given to the returned content scrape, which is systematically converted into a Unicode format that's safe for coding.<br>As part of this procedure, we identify and replace certain patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their equivalent symbols, and transform specific HTML entity codes into spaces and carriage returns, thereby improving block readability. This method allows the team to evaluate readable blocks effectively and discover any "new" patterns, which aids in documenting necessary remediation steps. This systematic approach prepares us for the eventual removal of style and script blocks, creating the necessary tickets or steps as required.<br>Numbered Steps:<br>
<br>Begin by running the remediation of all editorially included links that are set to "Save" before initiating the audit.
<br>Perform an <a data-href="#Audit Report" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/#Audit_Report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Audit Report</a> of content areas that contain script and style blocks on the page.
<br>Ensure the returned content scrap is converted into a code-safe Unicode because of the <a data-href="#Content Scrape Limitations" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/#Content_Scrape_Limitations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Content Scrape Limitations</a>.
<br>Identify and replace specific patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their corresponding symbols.
<br>Substitute certain HTML entity codes into space and transform others into carriage returns.
<br>Evaluate the now readable blocks after the aforementioned transformations.
<br>Discover any new patterns that emerge from the evaluation, and document the appropriate <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Remediation" data-href="Remediation" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/remediation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">remediation steps</a>.
<br>Finally, create any necessary tickets or steps to prepare for the obliteration of style and script blocks.
<br><br><br><br>To make the code more readable, it's crucial to replace certain Unicode characters with their typical representations. Specifically, we'll be dealing with the following conversions:<br>
<br>The Unicode for the carriage return, _000D_, should be replaced with a visual marker for carriage returns such as the symbol "↵".
<br>The Unicode for the horizontal tab, _0009_, could be replaced with a few spaces for better visualization.
<br>The Unicode for the space, _0020_, can be substituted with a visible space character.
<br>The line feed character, represented by the Unicode _000A_, can be swapped with a new line symbol like "␤" to depict line breaks better.
<br>The tab character, also represented by _0009_, should be replaced with a few spaces for clarity.
<br>Finally, the Unicode for less than and greater than symbols, &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;, can be converted to their actual "&lt;" and "&gt;" symbols.
<br>By transforming these Unicode characters into their corresponding visual representations, we significantly enhance the comprehensibility of the document, thus facilitating easier identification of different elements and their spacing.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Audit of Editorial UI.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 17:47:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>The process of bulk conversion is a nuanced operation that significantly depends on the scope of the pages being converted. Each bulk conversion task is unique, and while insights and learnings from previous conversions inform the process, it's important to note that a bespoke report is produced after each conversion. This report, presented in an Excel document, is a crucial tool that outlines the User Interface (UI) items within the editorial scope - including Rich Text and Custom Scripts - that require remediation following the conversion. The items are neatly categorized by sheet, each containing the Item ID, URL, and proposed remediation notes. This systematic approach provides a comprehensive view of the areas within the CMS that may need review, adjustments, or those indicating a potential function failure. Typical remediation steps include actions like "let fail," "add classes," "remove," and "replace with components," but this list is not exhaustive. If more complex actions are needed, additional notes may be added for clarity. This meticulous process ensures an efficient and methodical approach to addressing changes and potential issues post-conversion.<br><br>A listing of all pages effected by the conversion<br><br><br>]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/editorial-bulk-change-notice-excel.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 15:22:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Remediation]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Frontend development continues to expand as a percentage of project coding to the point that some of our products, such as the clinical applications, are 100% frontend code. Over the past year, I have been putting work together to support a massive shift in how we do frontend and, in the long run, how we develop, support, and release our college software solutions.&nbsp;<br>The most significant issue I continually see in IT is decentralized coding efforts. Decentralization leads to repetitive solutions, inconsistent behaviors, extended regression testing, bloated packages, complicated deployments, and potential code errors as we try to make security patches or upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Focusing on improving how we execute frontend for the college and not just for a project, I have tackled four pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>Unification of design but building for flexibility
<br>Shifting to the CFD (component first development )
<br>Creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored
<br>Centralizing everything for everyone
<br>The unification of design was the first place I started. "Arches" is the current solution that enforces a Design Opps procedure to streamline requests and deliver a college-wide design system. This design system has two tenants. First, it can replicate its styles influenced by the brand and frameworks from its product space. It now covers QII, ACC, Cardiosmart, and Mobile and can be further scaled. Second is its utility framework that ensures a highly flexible practice to allow countless UI permutations without CSS mutations. Utility styling is also known as "scopeless" styling because you can build out many UI patterns without ever altering the original styles.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/" target="_blank">https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/</a><br>Shifting to CFD (component first development) embraces an architecture for our frontend products and alters how we develop. CFD, as a pattern, has been around since 2012 with bootstrap. In its infancy, CFD could only capture minor token UI. Still, with the introduction of javascript models like Web Components, React, Vue CFD can now capture business logic, complicated interface interactions, and data mutations. Vue has been my primary focus as it builds on the collective knowledge of the department. Vue has the capabilities to make obsolete Jquery UI, Pager, Knockout, Angular, JqueryMobile, and many other libraries that are currently in use. IT streamlining to a single dependency allows for universal software patching for frontend security issues.&nbsp;<br>Currently, we are creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored. As we shift to CFD, we can use Storybook which allows for documentation around a living singular component with artificial data. This type of documentation gives a single point of Design, Development, and QA. The effort on a single element can be attached to countless projects through version control. Centralized development and QA can give us a feasible path to automated unit testing and regression testing. As new projects come online, utilizing the global-version-controlled components would benefit from standards, consistency, and quality control. Preliminary work done with Storybook around a future product under the ACC.org "Home Page Redesign." Projects could include the transcript, CSTool, GL Search, Coveo Search, and FIT Management. <br>Vue 2 component for reference<br>

I have conversations  GM, Josh G, and Micheal M, and the great work of Ling C on creating a path forward with using assets.acc.org and also moving the newly used submodule features from GIT  within current and future products. Submodules empower the component work to be checked in and out from both the centralized-version-control and from projects, these efforts can be kept in sync. The vision for this project is to be controlled by ACC but utilizable by vendors.  ]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/arches/front-end-design-at-the-college.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Front End Design at the College.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 20 Jul 2023 21:31:14 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[KSS Documentation]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>KSS, or Knyle Style Sheets, is a documentation syntax for CSS that allows developers to create a living style guide from CSS comments. It's structured to be both human-readable and machine-parsable, enabling automated tools to generate style guides from your CSS files. Here's an example of a comprehensive KSS comment block for a CSS stylesheet, including all the main options it can have:<br>/*
A button suitable for giving a user a call to action.

Style guide: Components.Buttons.Primary

:hover             - Highlights when hovered.
:disabled          - Dims the button when it cannot be interacted with.
.small             - A smaller button for less important actions.
.large             - A larger button for more important actions.

Markup:
&lt;button class="btn {{modifier_class}}"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;

Modifiers:
- .small - A small version of the primary button
- .large - A large version of the primary button

State classes:
- .is-active - Highlights the button as active
- .is-disabled - Shows the button as disabled

Variables:
- $btn-background-color: Color of the button background.
- $btn-text-color: Color of the button text.

$btn-background-color: #007bff;
$btn-text-color: #ffffff;

@brand Primary

 <br>Contextual Setup for My Request:<br>I want you to understand and act in the specific context of being a Product Owner on a SCRUM team. Your role is to write backlog tickets for a new feature, considering all aspects typical of a Product Owner's responsibilities in a real-world scenario. I expect the tone and approach of your responses to reflect this role and context. After the prompt please ask up to 3 follow up questions if you any clarifications or supporting details. Here are some key points I want you to consider:<br>
<br>SCRUM Methodology Awareness: You should demonstrate a clear understanding of SCRUM principles and practices.
<br>Role-Specific Knowledge: As a Product Owner, your focus is on maximizing the value of the product and the work of the development team.
<br>Feature-Specific Requirements: The backlog tickets you will create should be for a specific feature, detailed in my request.
<br>User-Centric Approach: Emphasize the importance of user stories and prioritize tasks based on user needs and project goals.
<br>Communication Style: Your responses should mirror the communication style of a Product Owner - clear, decisive, and oriented towards actionable items.
<br>Writing Style: Concise and clear, with a preference for listing items rather than writing out in sentences, to facilitate easy scanning.
<br>Project Introduction:<br>
<br>Subject Matter: Tech stack - ASP, Vue, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CMS Sitecore or Sitefinity
<br>Internal Terms: [Clarification on terms like ARCHES, PaperCrane, ACC.org, CardioSmart, etc.]

<br>ARCHES is a comprehensive front-end design system by the American College of Cardiology. It uses advanced compiler techniques to generate variations that integrate with different frameworks and brands, making it versatile for various ACC products. ARCHES primarily consists of utility classes that offer a modern approach to CSS, focusing on single-style control and separation of responsibilities between HTML and CSS. This system is flexible and adaptable, used across multiple ACC platforms, including ACC.org and CardioSmart, and supports distinct brand styles while maintaining overall coherence.
<br>PaperCrane refers to a Component Library specifically designed for Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. This library is utilized in the development of Single Page Applications (SPAs). PaperCrane  contains a collection of pre-built Vue components which can be reused across different parts of the enterprise application, enhancing development speed and ensuring UI consistency.
<br>ACC.org ACC.org is the official website of the American College of Cardiology. It serves as a comprehensive resource for cardiology professionals, offering a wide range of content including clinical updates, educational materials, guidelines, and information on cardiology conferences and events. The site is designed to support medical professionals in the field of cardiology with the latest scientific research, policy advocacy, and continuous education. It also provides tools and resources for practice support, quality improvement, and patient care in the cardiovascular field. The website caters to the needs of cardiologists, providing them with essential information to advance their knowledge and practice.
<br>CardioSmart.org is a patient-centered website created by the American College of Cardiology. It provides comprehensive information about heart health and various cardiac conditions. The site is dedicated to educating patients, offering resources on heart diseases, healthy living tips, and tools to manage cardiac health. It includes topics such as heart disease prevention, treatment options, and lifestyle changes.

<br>Dependencies: Any dependencies or prerequisites for the ticket.
<br>Backlog Ticket Creation:<br>Follow the Updated Backlog Ticket Structure provided above to detail your response for this ticket In the Prompt Details below I will detail the information I have for the ticket.<br>Prompt Details:<br>
<br>Heading: Article "Children Renderings" Conversion to Arches
<br>Introduction: The Sitecore renderings for the sub types of articles need to be converted so Articles can be utilized in the CMS
<br>Main Content:<br>
The "children renderings" for articles to be built out into Arches. The "children renderings" of article are:

<br>ClinicalTrial
<br>GuidelineHub
<br>JournalScan
<br>PressRelease
<br>Recommentation
<br>TenPoints
<br>This might not be a complete list<br>
Suggested approach for completing this ticket is to have JOINT DEVELOPMENT EFFORT as a 3 hour meeting<br>
1st Step Setup environment for JOINT DEVELOPEMNT (Ling + ASP Dev )<br>
Establish a working version of all article children types within a local environment that can be referenced<br>
2nd Step JOINT DEVELOPEMNT MEETING (Ling, Matt, Rowena, Jacob, and ASP Dev)<br>
Work through any and all architectural, backend and UI alterations needed to convert all these children renderings into full arches.<br>

 <br>Full Page Splashes,  orphan pages, or  marketing landing pages are isolated pages within our website's architecture that are not linked from the homepage and should be used sparingly and strategically. These pages exist outside of our website's primary navigation and can inadvertently disrupt a user's browsing experience. As a rule, these pages should only be created in specific scenarios - such as part of a well-defined marketing campaign with a predetermined lifespan.<br><br>Before implementing a Full Page Splash, ensure all of the following criteria are met:<br>
<br>The page is directly tied to a specific marketing campaign. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>The page has a limited lifespan with a clearly established takedown date. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>The page is structured within the Sitecore folder, specifically under Parent of Main Branch/features. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>The content is succinct enough to fit on a single page without overwhelming the user. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>The content is not intended to be organically discovered from the main site, and does not contribute to the overall SEO strategy. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>All intended conversion points are a single click away.  → Buy, Register, etc... <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a>

<br><br>
<br>Assess the potential impact on user experience. Ensure that the Full Page Splash aligns with the user journey and does not disrupt it. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>Review the content strategy to ensure that the Full Page Splash complements it, rather than creating dissonance. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>Evaluate the necessity of a Full Page Splash versus incorporating the content into the existing site structure. <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#checklist</a> 
<br>Plan for future content updates or potential expansions.

 <br>As a developer, I need to create a "Hero Image with CTA" component to be utilized in the ACC.org microsites to deliver a captivating user experience while promoting specific campaigns or products.<br><br>
<br>
Arches CSS Version: The component should be developed and tested using the latest version of Arches CSS, as this depends on the component's production.

<br>
Design Pattern Adherence: The component should strictly follow the design pattern provided at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/boot_acc/item-recipes-microsite-heroimagewithcta.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/boot_acc/item-recipes-microsite-heroimagewithcta.html" target="_blank">this link</a>. All styling, formatting, and elements in the design pattern should be correctly incorporated into the component.

<br>
Image Resizing for Multiple Devices: The component should use the provided image sizes based on the device viewed: Desktop Size 1200x300, Laptop Size 1024x256, Tablet Size 600x300, Small Size 300x450.

<br>
Breadcrumb Navigation: The component should display breadcrumb navigation that includes a back arrow and the connecting page of the main site this microsite connects to.

<br>
Configurable Microsite Title: The component should include a scalable title that adjusts its size based on the viewport.

<br>
Configurable CTA Title, Description, Button URL, and Label: The component should have fields for the CTA title, description, button URL, and label that can be configured to meet the needs of the specific campaign or product being promoted.

<br><br>
<br>The "Hero Image with CTA" component is completed and meets the acceptance criteria.
<br>The user experience team has reviewed the component.
<br>After Deployment, training is set for the Editors to know and use the new component.

 <br><br><br>As an editor of ACC.org, I need a  Micro Branding with Microsite Title component for ACC.org microsites. This new component aims to provide an engaging user experience and promote specific campaigns or products, while also ensuring a clear link back to the microsite home along with the page title.<br><br>
<br>Arches CSS version: The component should be developed and tested using the latest version of Arches CSS.
<br>Design pattern: The component should strictly adhere to the design pattern provided at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/boot_acc/item-recipes-microsite-heroimagewithcta.html" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/boot_acc/item-recipes-microsite-heroimagewithcta.html" target="_blank">this link</a>.
<br>Image resizing: The component should resize the image based on the device viewed: For all sizes (Desktop, Laptop, Tablet), the height should be minimized at all time to reduce consumption of "Above the Fold Areas."
<br>Breadcrumb navigation: The component should display breadcrumb navigation that includes a back arrow and the connecting page of the main site this microsite connects to.
<br>Configurable microsite title: The component should include a scalable title that adjusts its size based on the viewport.
<br>This component should be able to be placed full-wide above the page structure of Left Sidebar and Main Content.

Each page is a chapter of the initiative's story, aimed to guide users to a strategically defined conversion point. Here's an outline of the elements:<br>
<br>Home of the Initiative: This main, full-screen page serves as the prologue to the initiative's story, providing a pathway back to the main ACC.org site. It features a text-free, richly layered hero image, a compelling call-to-action (CTA), and supportive information to propel the narrative. Additional CTAs invite visitors to explore further details.  

<br>Hero Image: This visually arresting image, free from text and easily adaptable to cropping or trimming, imbues the microsite with a unique "flair" or brand identity. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hero Image with CTA" data-href="Hero Image with CTA" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/components/hero-image-with-cta.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Hero Image Requirement</a>
<br>Initiative CTA and Hero Image: The microsite distinguishes itself from the main ACC.org site through its unique branding, represented by the hero image and a clear, persuasive CTA. This combination piques user interest and encourages action.


<br>Sub-Pages and Micro Branding: Consistent branding is carried through to each sub-page via a smaller image that reflects the "flair" of the home page's hero image. These pages, adhering to comprehensive content creation guidance, utilize a sidebar navigation layout and always lead back to the "Home of the Initiative". <a data-href="Micro Branding with Page Title" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/components/micro-branding-with-page-title.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Micro Branding with Page Title</a>

<br>Purpose-Driven Sub-Pages and Conversion Points: Every sub-page plays a crucial role in the initiative's narrative, either by presenting a primary CTA, providing deeper information, or hosting a set of conversion points. Each page aims to drive the user towards a conversion, fulfilling the strategic needs of the microsite.


<br>This well-crafted design ensures a distinct, narrative-driven user experience within the microsite while maintaining a strong link to the broader ACC.org environment.<br><a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:acc/guidance" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/guidance</a> <a href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump?query=tag:acc/org/microsite" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/org/microsite</a> ]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/anatomy-of-a-microsite.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/Microsites/Anatomy of a Microsite.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2023 16:08:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Checklist for a Viability]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a> <a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/org/microsite" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/org/microsite</a> 
 <br>Checklist/Questioner for BL to fill out before a new microsite is created:<br>
<br>
What is the specific purpose or initiative? How is it important?

<br>
What is the conversion goal or mission for the users to accomplish?&nbsp; Must be specific, with high strategic value to the college.

<br>
What is the specific target audience? What is unique or separate about the target population?

<br>
What is the timeline for this initiative?

<br>
What about the design is different from the ACC brand?

<br>How is it unique?
<br>How is it complex?
<br>How is it self-contained?


<br>
How is the functionality different from what is offered on the ACC.org site?

<br>
Where does it fit within the existing ACC.org site?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (It shouldn’t, but listing this would identify the gap.)

<br>Optional aspects :<br>
<br>Partnership or collaboration - is there a joint partner?

 <br>A microsite, also termed a landing page or brochure pages, is an independent yet integrative subsection within the main ACC.org framework. Though this division bears the basic branding of the main site, it introduces its unique sub-branding elements. These components establish a distinct identity, subtly differentiating the microsite while preserving coherence with the main brand. The structure of the microsite comprises multiple interconnected pages that form an exclusive navigation tree. This enclosed network ensures that each page links exclusively to other pages within the microsite, creating a tailored, immersive user journey. With a clearly defined central focus and goal, the microsite serves as a concentrated platform for strategic communication and user interaction.<br>TLDR Quick Read<br>
<br>Microsite: A distinct, yet cohesive, self-contained subsection within the ACC.org site.
<br>Sub Branding Elements: Unique branding features that distinguish the microsite from the main ACC.org brand, yet align with its basic branding.
<br>Enclosed Navigation Tree: The microsite encompasses a network of pages that interlink exclusively within its own scope, creating a customized navigation experience.
<br>Central Focus and Goal: The microsite is crafted with a specific objective, functioning as a dedicated communication and engagement platform.
<br>Aliases: The microsite is also known as Landing Page and Brochure Pages.

Think of it as an independent information hub under the main site's umbrella, opening with a vibrant full-page introduction of its theme. Its content, organized in an exclusive structure of related sub-pages, enables users to delve deeper into the specific topic without other site distractions.<br>Microsites represent a calculated approach for presenting semi-independent projects. While they adhere to most of ACC.org's branding guidelines, their unique design and structure allow them to serve as focused resources for users.<br>However, creating a microsite is not always advisable due to costs and other considerations. It's generally reserved for significant initiatives that are notably important, brandable, unique, complex, and self-contained. In such instances, a microsite can offer significant value.

Acting semi-independently from the main site, it caters to a niche audience or user need that benefits from a narrowed scope and tailored options, away from the broader offerings of the main site.<br>The microsite adopts the fundamental branding guidelines of ACC.org while introducing its unique design, structure, and organization. This concentration of tailored information and user actions makes it an effective tool for engagement.<br><br>
<br>Focused Content: Microsites allow you to create content that is highly targeted towards a specific audience or topic. This can help improve user engagement and conversion rates for that specific topic or audience.
<br>Product Brand Alterations: Microsites provide an opportunity to apply branding and design strategies unique to the product.  
<br>Campaign-Specific Messaging: Microsites can be an effective tool for unique marketing campaigns or product launches, where a dedicated site can deliver a focused message.
<br>Fast Deployment: Microsites can typically be augmented and launched more quickly than adding substantial new sections to an existing site. Most often this work is bespoke and one off.
<br>Flexibility: Microsites can be easily tweaked or shut down without affecting the rest of the company's web presence.
<br>User Experience: Microsites can offer a more streamlined and targeted user experience, leading to improved customer satisfaction and conversion rates for a product.
<br>Improved Tracking: It may be easier to track the effectiveness of a specific campaign or audience through a microsite, as analytics can be specifically tailored for the site.  
<br>Independence: If different departments or branches of a company want to maintain a certain level of autonomy in their web presence, microsites can offer this independence.
<br><br>While microsites can be valuable tools, they also come with inherent challenges that can affect your digital strategy. These challenges underline the fact that while microsites can be effective for specific initiatives, they should be used judiciously and with clear purpose, given the potential costs involved.<br>
<br>Brand Consistency: Operating multiple microsites can disrupt brand uniformity and recognition, causing customer confusion.
<br>Increased Management Complexity: The operation and maintenance of various microsites amplify the complexity of website management, requiring additional resources. The bespoke nature of the code might also lead to problems during system upgrades.
<br>SEO Risks: Microsites could cannibalize the SEO value of the main site and end up competing with it in search results.
<br>

<br>User Navigation and Context Confusion: Due to their distinctive branding and self-contained nature, microsites can create navigation challenges for users. Moving between multiple microsites and the main site can lead to a disorienting user experience. This context-switching confusion is typically less prevalent in a single, unified site of the main site.


<br>Content Duplication: Managing content across the main sites and isolated microsites introduces the risk of duplication and subsequent issues with content upkeep, maintenance  and SEO.
<br>Traffic Dilution: Traffic is dispersed across multiple microsites instead of being directed to one central site, leading to a dilution of traffic on the main site and less cross-site discovery.
<br>Discoverability: If not directly linked or referenced from the main site, microsites may be more difficult for users to find.
<br>Sustainability: Maintaining and updating numerous microsites over time can prove challenging, potentially resulting in outdated information.

We should set high thresholds for what qualifies a topic or campaign for a separate microsite. Rather than creating a microsite, the default Generic Page approach should be utilized incorporated within the information architecture of our main site. Only when the content meets exceptionally stringent criteria—whether that's relevance, audience specificity, or uniqueness—should we consider the development of a standalone microsite.<br><br>
<br>
Specific Target Audience: Content needs to be tailored to a highly specific audience that can't be effectively targeted through the main site.

<br>
Unique Campaign: The content should pertain to a unique, typically time-bound campaign that requires distinct messaging separate from the broader brand or company offerings.    

<br>
SEO Strategy: The microsite should have a clear, separate SEO strategy focused on keywords and topics not covered by the main site.

<br>
User Experience: The microsite should offer a uniquely engaging user experience, such as an interactive product demo or immersive storytelling, that wouldn't fit well within the main site.

<br>
Unique Functional Requirements: The microsite should require functionality not supported or feasible on the main site, such as a unique user registration process, specific eCommerce setup, or API integrations.

<br><br>
<br>
New Product Launch: The content should relate to the launch of a new product or service that could benefit from focused attention and doesn't fit neatly into the existing site structure.

<br>
Event Promotion: The content should promote a specific event that warrants its own promotional and informational space.

<br>
Partnership or Collaboration: The microsite should be created for a joint venture, partnership, or collaboration with another entity, where separate branding and messaging is crucial.

<br>
Geographic Specificity: The microsite should cater to a specific geographic market that has unique needs separate from the main audience.

<br><br>
<br>Cost-Benefit Analysis: There should be a clear financial and strategic advantage to creating the microsite, with projected benefits outweighing the costs of development, maintenance, and potential dilution of brand or SEO.
<br>Defined Lifespan: Each microsite should have a defined lifespan, whether short-term or long-term. This timeframe should align with its strategic objectives, such as ongoing updates or serving as a reference resource. The expected lifespan should justify its creation and separate maintenance, ensuring it brings value during its entire existence.

<br><a data-href="SPA Intake" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/jira/spa-intake.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">SPA Intake</a> Ticket kicks all of this off
<br>Design and Requirements
<br>Technical Feasibility
<br>Design Iteration Follow Up from Technical Feasibility
<br>Basic Application: Data &amp; API
<br>Basic Application: Page Construction, Code Branch, Page Access
<br>Basic Application: Vue APP SHELL
<br>Basic Application: Application Initiation.
<br>Component Construction: 1 – Many Tickets
<br>Application Specifics | Feature X scaffolding: 1 – Many Tickets
<br>Application Integration with Components | Feature X Refinement with QA: 1 – Many Tickets
<br><br><br>These types of tickets come in phases where many of the branches can work in partnership moving the designed application forward with some autonomy.<br><br>These tickets are iterative and often are labeled the “Sprint 0” depending on the ask from the product owner and how developed the concept is before the team receives the project this will be iterative. Often this should be a set of meetings and reviews between the UX Team and Technical Architect and Front-End Senior Lead with responses sent back to the UX team and ultimately the Product Owner. Depending on how “Lean” you want to run the project this can be as lean as a rough sketch where the particulars are hashed out in the project to full-blown comps with requirement notes being captured in the Parent “Epic” Ticket. Initial talks of analytics should be talked about prompt the BL to reach out to the analytics team to establish this branch of the requirements.<br><br>When the receiving team is comfortable with the clarity of the intended product this phase will break down the ask into dispersible tickets. Depending on the skill and resources these tickets can be sized appropriately for the team. Basic Application Construction can start on day one considering the scaffolding is fundamental to any other work.<br><br>Independent work is brought together in this phase. It is common that co-working and JAD sessions occur in these tickets as team members bring together the individual efforts. There is no clean break of this phase to previous depending on the delivery it is common that a feature might go through all phases and be QA’d before other features are even started.<br><br><br>Design Phase is the most prone to change. This phase should be mostly completed before the rest of the tasks should start. There is always reason, technical or just iterating over an experience that can cause changes to the design but if the team has a good idea of what is being built and rework will be reduced. The tenants of AGILE does allow for iteration so it is inevitable that rework or alteration will happen. Documenting for the team should migrate to comments on design documents because living design documents are costly and in the end are a non-production artifact. It is very important that the Technology Team (DEV &amp; UI Lead) break down the steps and familiarize themselves with the nuances of the features to intelligently question the design and highlight possible issues before alterations become more impactful to the timelines. QA at this point can even scaffold out User Tests on features during this step.<br><br><br>Team review of the UX design of Project X. Highlight and Flag and Feasibility Changes and Iterate over them with the UX team. Team will submit a scaffolding of tickets to produce the Application. Details should include Data needs, Implementation Specifics, Analytics definitions, and Front-End Breakdown.<br><br><br>These steps are mostly dependent on the previous and could be collapsed to a single ticket but the ambiguity of the Data API it is best to keep these tickets into separate tickets to utilize a wider base of resources.<br><br><br>API &amp; Data Structures to support the application outline the data handshake and return results for App Build Team &amp; UI Team.<br><br>A user may only visit the URL if the user is logged in. The page will do all needed steps to redirect the user through log in in needed and redirect the user back to the page after success. Define URL &amp; create the hosting page in Sitecore.<br><br>A user should be able to visit a URL and have an application on that page respond to the visitor with the information it has available to it. Create the shell of the application and establish needed hooks to the data the application will know. This information is defined by the project but in the most basic definitions the application will know about the User, and possibly the URL and any query structures.<br><br>When the user visits the application, and it is loaded the application will initiate and collect information through API calls to store any data that is needed to display information and formulate any actions needed for the user defined by the project.<br><br><br>Components should follow the single tenant that they are only responsible for data passed to them and emitting their context. This separates concerns when the Application takes most of the features and components can stay agnostic.<br>When creating components all new components will be created with the library’s project folder. If the team finds value for a specific component that is generic enough to be reusable across many applications, the component can be promoted to a common library folder. Be aware that common components require a greater level of flexibility and scope to make them bullet proof for generic consumption.<br><br><br>Component tickets should encompass basic mutations that are needed for that component. Basic examples or mutations are Size, Location or Inclusion, Props (Data they will display), Validations, States, Etc. This should result in a Code Review and a Demo with UX Team and Product Owner. To reduce meeting overload, they can be grouped with other tickets or be deferred to the Feature Refinement Ticket<br><br><br>The user should be able to see the data they need to see and interact with data as defined by the requirements this is known as feature. In many cases features can be scaffolded with their data and methods without the need of utilizing components. Operations of an application like looping, reductions, additions, removals, data hooks and server responses can be all worked out without the use of components.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature. <br>For Example, “scaffold delete this line item from the list.” This will produce a data storage, list and methods and listeners that can be used to remove data from the list. This would also include any database API and deal with the response return updating the stored data of the list.<br><br><br>Inclusion of components and refinement of the frontend features. These phases will “wire” data and properties to components into the application. Depending on the size of the application these can be broken down into Features, or Pages, or States. This is the moment where components are due from the front-end teams. The deployment of components can be more staggered if the team is more comfortable with constant deployments. The benefits of this would be a lister would be available much earlier in the development process but may need to be updated or rewired if changes to validation or data needs alter in the refinement process.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature in the App<br>For Example, “A user by clicking on the delete button on a list item should delete it from the list.” Render a data list with the delete button. On the click add a listener to the application that will trigger the delete feature that has been scaffolded. QA this feature. Demo this Feature with UX Team and Product Owner.]]></description><link>https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/spa/outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/SPA/Outline of Tickets for SPAs in Vue.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matt Watier]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 19:25:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Story First Content]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="https://acc-style.github.io/BrainDump/?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a>

In the first sentence or area of the page the user should easily tell the action they should take.  And every piece of content should support, educate, or compel the user to act upon the task of the page. <br>Reduce - Reductive writing is best online users shy away from long blurbs of text.<br>
Reuse - Don't repeat similar or same blocks of text or content. If there are reasons for content to be used in multiple areas - link to it, or pattern it as a resource that users an engage with if they need it.<br>
Recycle- The title of the page you are linking to is usually not enough to be engaging. <br>
<br>Put the link within the text of the page,
<br>rewrite the hook to get users to the page by lifting up concepts and reasons for the user to engage with the link to navigate to it.
