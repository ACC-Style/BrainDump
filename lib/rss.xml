 <br><br><br>A refactor is an effort to apply enterprise design and strategic guidance to a small section of pages or a specific zone of the website. A refactor enforces:<br>
<br>Goal setting<br>

<br>Audience focus<br>

<br>Application of UI standards from Arches<br>

<br>Content retooling based on the Content Strategy Playbook<br>

<br><br>The optimal timeline, as outlined by the EDSC Teams, is 10 weeks.<br><br>
<br>Timelines may shift due to business priorities, team response times, and scope changes.<br>

<br>Delays can occur when external parties miss deadlines for returning deliverables or scheduling meetings.<br>

<br>IT components, such as adding dynamic feeds and personalization, can extend the timeline by 3-6 weeks or more.<br>

<br><br>The Refactor Team includes members from:<br>
<br>Enterprise Content Team<br>

<br>UX Team<br>

<br>Client SME (Subject Matter Expert) responsible for providing necessary inputs to ensure project success.<br>

<br><br><br>
<br>
Step 1: Review (Weeks 1-3)

<br>
Step 2: Content Design (Week 4)

<br>
Step 3: Content Creation (Week 5)

<br>
Step 4: Iterating and Reacting to Real Content (Week 6)

<br>
Step 5: Editing (Weeks 7-8)

<br>
Step 6: Publishing (Weeks 9-10)

<br><br><br><br>
<br>The Client submits a project intake form on the Monday Platform.<br>

<br>Project intake review:

<br>Intake form is assessed.<br>

<br>Team is assembled (Marketing, SME, Client, UX, EDS, Analytics).<br>

<br>Kick-off meeting is conducted.<br>

<br>Deadlines are reviewed.<br>

<br>Project enters the UX and EDS backlog.<br>



<br>Timeline begins once the project is picked up from the backlog.<br>

<br><br>
<br>SME Responsibilities:

<br>Provide all relevant content (Web, Communications, Print Materials, Marketing).<br>

<br>Meet with Analytics to define reporting needs.<br>



<br>Evaluation &amp; Retooling:

<br>Content is reviewed and adjusted based on goals and audience.<br>

<br>Follow-up Discovery Meeting conducted.<br>



<br><br>
<br>Tailored content delivery may include:

<br>Wireframes<br>

<br>Process Flows<br>

<br>Publication Schedules (Marketing involvement)<br>

<br>Content Collection Documents<br>

<br>Outline of required artwork (Marketing contribution)<br>



<br><br>
<br>Content is completed based on refactor team guidelines.<br>

<br>Marketing request:

<br>If required, artwork is created by Marketing.<br>



<br><br>
<br>The content collection document may require a refactor of UI structures outlined in wireframes.<br>

<br><br>
<br>Team reviews and finalizes:

<br>Artifacts<br>

<br>Wireframes<br>

<br>Content<br>

<br>Design elements<br>

<br>Artwork<br>



<br>Once approved, materials are prepared for Production.<br>

<br><br><br>
<br>The Refactor Team submits all final content and designs to the editorial team via Jira Ticket.<br>

<br><br>
<br>The Refactor Team liaises with stakeholders to ensure smooth project progression through Author Site.<br>

<br><br>
<br>SME, Marketing, and Client conduct final reviews and corrections on the Author Site.<br>

<br>After final approval, the Web Production Team releases the Refactor Pages to the live site.<br>

 <br><br><br>The file includes all the necessary assets to create guideline algorithms, ensuring consistency across all designs. To maintain the established design system, use the provided color swatches, Illustrator panels, and graphic, character, and paragraph styles.<br>These design enforcements support a consistent experience and are reader-focused, making the algorithms easy to read, understand, and provide valuable information like the CORs (Class of Recommendation). The algorithm is mostly monochromatic, with a focus on high contrast separation between the background and text to improve readability. COR colors are used specifically to highlight important information, ensuring that critical details stand out for the reader.<br><br>
<br>Node and Decision Symbols: Always use the predefined symbols for nodes and decisions. These symbols are already designed to align with the correct COR color and shape, ensuring that each element is visually consistent and recognizable.<br>

<br>Line and Label Symbols: Use the predefined line and label symbols to maintain consistent visual direction and clarity. Lines such as "YES," "NO," and the avoid markers are standardized for effective communication.<br>

<br>Node Binders: Use symbols like NODE BINDER -- AND, NODE BINDER -- OR, and NODE BINDER -- ANY to represent logical connections between nodes clearly. This ensures that all decision junctions are presented in a consistent manner.<br>

<br>Line Styles: Lines connecting nodes are styled consistently with arrows indicating the direction of flow. There are no variations in line thickness.<br>

<br>Text Alignment: Text within each node should be aligned to the left and vertically centered to enhance readability.<br>

<br>Legend Placement: Place the legend in the top right corner by default. If there is insufficient space, use the bottom right, followed by the bottom left. Legends should never be placed in the top left.<br>

<br>Refer to the finished example to understand how these elements work together to create a consistent and branded algorithm design.<br><br>The Illustrator file is set up with an artboard named "Toolkit," which contains all the essential elements for designing guideline algorithms. This toolkit includes:<br>
<br>Symbols: Predefined symbols such as data nodes, decision shapes, and other graphic elements.<br>

<br>Graphic Styles: Graphic Styles are used for line styles and arrows, applying the consistent look and feel to lines and arrows based on a simple line in Illustrator.<br>

<br>Character Styles: The character styles in the file include options for titles, labels, node content, and more. Use the Title style for main headings, Zone Label for section labels, and Node Regular or Node Strong for content within nodes. There are also specific styles for COR Labels to ensure that Class of Recommendation values stand out appropriately.<br>

<br>Paragraph Styles: Utilize the Paragraph Styles to maintain consistency across body text and labels. For instance, use Node Text for text within nodes and Footnotes for any additional information provided at the bottom of the algorithm. The Line Labels style ensures all directional labels (e.g., "YES," "NO") are clearly formatted.<br>

<br>Color Swatches: The approved color palette for decision points and node types.<br>

<br>Toolkit Artboard: Refer to the toolkit artboard to quickly access and apply these elements.<br>

<br><br>
<br>Use the Toolkit: Start by using the elements provided in the toolkit artboard to maintain consistency.<br>

<br>Smart Alignment: Use smart guides to align elements properly, ensuring nodes align in the same column for a clean and professional layout.<br>

 <br>Subject: Exciting Opportunity: Redesigning Member Sections<br>Dear Team,<br>As we embark on the transformative journey of redesigning our Member Sections, I want to share an overview of our strategic process and the essential tasks that will lead to our success. This initiative, commencing after the Annual Meeting in April 2025, involves over twenty sections and will require our collective effort to achieve outstanding consistency and quality.<br><br>Leading up to April 2025, Jackie, Laura, and I will concentrate on several key tasks to establish a solid foundation:<br>
<br>
Proof of Concept (POC):

<br>We will finalize a robust WIC POC to define our preferred tone, brevity, and structure. This benchmark will guide all pages and content styles.


<br>
Content Access Guidelines:

<br>After cleaning up existing content, Jackie and I will draft clear guidelines delineating public-facing content from that exclusive to members. We'll circulate this initial draft to the Tiger team for insights.


<br>
IT Development Planning:

<br>Armed with the POC, we will collaborate with leadership to outline and align on our anticipated IT development requirements for dynamic content and and the user onboarding logic.


<br>
Content and Resources Collection:

<br>Our team will create an effective initiation script and a user-friendly content collection form to streamline the content-gathering process for our liaisons.


<br>This groundwork will empower us to seamlessly engage with staff liaisons following the Annual Meeting.<br><br>Content collection for our Member Sections is scheduled to begin in April 2025. To optimize our resources, we will prioritize which sections to revamp first.<br>
<br>
Kickoff Meeting/Workshop:

<br>We will introduce the dedicated project team and the creative assets needed for content collection. 
<br>Matt and Jackie will lead a workshop to showcase an illustrative section while demonstrating the collection form.


<br>
Content Collection Responsibilities:

<br>Each section team will undertake the content collection and refactoring, utilizing the WIC POC as their guide. Our oversight will ensure alignment and quality throughout the process.


<br>
Completion of Content:

<br>Once content is gathered, our coordination team will collaborate with MarCom to generate essential images for prominent features.


<br>
Quality Assurance:

<br>A JIRA ticket will be created to document the creation of the newly refactored Member Section, ensuring transparency and tracking.


<br>
Editorial Review:

<br>Based on our priorities, the completed section will be processed, entered into Author, reviewed, and then published for production.


<br>
Repeat for All Sections:

<br>This process will be repeated systematically for all remaining sections.


<br><br>
<br>Early 2025: Finalize the POC, establish clear content guidelines, plan IT development, and prepare liaison resources.
<br>Post-Annual Meeting (April 2025): Launch engagement with liaisons and section teams to kick off content collection.
<br>If you have any questions or need further insights on this exciting project, please don’t hesitate to reach out. Together, we can create an exceptional experience for our members.<br>Looking forward to our collaboration,<br>

Before I start this, I want to ask you to "love this for 5 minutes," then you can react.<br>In the act of working with clients, we often take the content documents we are offered, and our reaction to doing IA is to take that content and shoehorn it into UI to satisfy the client.<br><br>For years and possibly decades, I have taken content documents and shaved off a word or two. However, I have come to realize the immense detriment I have been doing to the strategic approach to content creation by skipping to the UI answer. Instead of merely using 'Styled UI' to reshape, mutate, and hide content, we should focus on enhancing the content to bolster the user experience by solving the underlying issues that users might face with the content that was initially delivered.<br><br>I have a different opinion on why we shouldn't create wireframes this early in a project. For the sake of speed, we, myself included, often skip the IA step, rushing to return to the client with wireframes. We then cleverly force their content into blocks and hidden areas on the page. The downside of internalizing the IA within the team and applying layouts and UI to content is that it directs our conversations with business lines toward solutions, rather than focusing on improving the content on the site. This undermines the value that IA discussions can bring. Jumping straight to UI wires limits our ability to challenge how we receive and refine raw content. We should at least help them transform it before we start applying UI.<br>I want to ensure there is a moment when clients are encouraged and guided to evaluate the provided content. Content strategists can have the greatest impact by unlocking the potential for more effective and engaging content.<br><br>Here is an example of what happens when we skip straight to UI. The wireframes react to the content as it is provided. In the team's review of overwhelming content, we responded by using accordions in the UI to hide excess information. This was a superficial fix that masked the issue—that the content was too lengthy and not concise. No changes were made to the content itself because we had already hidden it.<br>Now we have introduced a situation where our users are forced into a discovery mode, and we haven't solved the problem that the content was too much or not aligned with the actual goals of the page.<br><br>To maximize the effectiveness of content, we need to change our approach. Instead of rushing into UI design, we should follow a structured process:<br>
<br>Content Evaluation: Review the content before doing any design work. Understand the purpose of the content and whether it aligns with the project's goals.
<br>Information Architecture (IA) Application: Use IA to refine, organize, and simplify the content into a logical structure. Ensure that the content is easily navigable and user-friendly.
<br>Content Transformation: Apply appropriate hierarchies and organize the text logically. If necessary, split the content across multiple pages to make it more digestible.

<br>This should be a word document
<br>You can outline that content is either series on the page or is in parallel.
<br>Should denote page breaks and how it is wired between pages.


<br>Content Presentation: Share the revised content with the client. Encourage them to review it in a Word document format so they can engage with the material and provide feedback.
<br>Content Refinement: Based on client feedback, refine the content further. Make sure it is concise, clear, and aligned with the project’s objectives.
<br>UI Design: Only after finalizing the content should we begin designing the UI. At this stage, the content will be well-organized, aligned with user goals, and ready to be integrated into the page layout.
<br>By following these steps, we ensure that the content drives the design, not the other way around. This structured approach leads to better user experiences and more effective communication.<br>
<br>Where does this go?
<br>Should this be another page?
<br>What is this content saying?
<br>Should we hide this from the user?
<br>What is the point of this page?
<br>What are the goals, and does this content support them?
<br>Let’s encourage our clients to review the content in a Word document. It’s important for them to read through the information and share their thoughts. This step is crucial to ensure that the content matches the project’s goals and is easy for users to understand. As content strategists, we should lead this conversation by presenting our findings and showing our dedication to delivering top-quality content.<br>Only when we have finalized the content can we move on to page designs and work on the UI.]]></description><link>work/acc/thoughts/not-using-ui-but-word-documents.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Thoughts/Not Using UI but Word Documents.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:18:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maximize Conversions with Integrated Marketing]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Email Marketing<br>Here’s a streamlined process flow for utilizing Direct Marketing Emails, Social Posts, and Web Marketing to drive users to landing pages with single goal CTAs, optimizing for conversion:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240924173228.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png"><br><br>
<br>Objective: Whether the goal is membership sign-up, promoting a specific product, or encouraging course enrollment, start with a clear and single-focused goal.<br>

<br>Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173258.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173258.png"><br><br>
<br>Personalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient.<br>

<br>Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product.<br>

<br>Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links.

<br>Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button.<br>



<br>Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173344.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173344.png"><br><br>
<br>Awareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly.<br>

<br>Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”.<br>

<br>Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement.<br>

<br>Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page.<br>

<br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click.

<br><br>
<br>Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment).<br>

<br><br>
<br>Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's "Join Now", "Sign Up", or "Purchase". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal.<br>

<br>Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience.<br>

<br>Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”).<br>

<br>Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173440.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173440.png"><br><br>
<br>Track Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions.<br>

<br>Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency.<br>

<br>Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips).<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173458.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173458.png"><br><br>
<br>
Direct Email:

<br>Send an email to non-members emphasizing the value of membership (e.g., “Unlock exclusive access to resources, discounts, and courses”).<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to membership sign-up landing page.<br>



<br>
Social Media Post:

<br>Post a testimonial or success story from a current member, emphasizing the benefits.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Learn More” → Redirect to landing page that further explains membership benefits.<br>



<br>
Website Banner Ad:

<br>Place a banner on relevant blog or content pages: “Become a Member Today and Get Access to Premium Courses”.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to landing page optimized for membership sign-ups.<br>



<br>By focusing on single-action CTAs, and maintaining consistent, clear messaging across all communication channels, this process maximizes the chances of conversion from email, social, and web marketing efforts.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173524.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173524.png">]]></description><link>work/acc/thoughts/maximize-conversions-with-integrated-marketing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Thoughts/Maximize Conversions with Integrated Marketing.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 23:54:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structure & Guidance]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br>
<br><a data-href="SPA Intake" href="work/acc/jira/spa-intake.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">SPA Intake</a> Ticket kicks all of this off
<br>Design and Requirements
<br>Technical Feasibility
<br>Design Iteration Follow Up from Technical Feasibility
<br>Basic Application: Data &amp; API
<br>Basic Application: Page Construction, Code Branch, Page Access
<br>Basic Application: Vue APP SHELL
<br>Basic Application: Application Initiation.
<br>Component Construction: 1 – Many Tickets
<br>Application Specifics | Feature X scaffolding: 1 – Many Tickets
<br>Application Integration with Components | Feature X Refinement with QA: 1 – Many Tickets
<br><br><br>These types of tickets come in phases where many of the branches can work in partnership moving the designed application forward with some autonomy.<br><br>These tickets are iterative and often are labeled the “Sprint 0” depending on the ask from the product owner and how developed the concept is before the team receives the project this will be iterative. Often this should be a set of meetings and reviews between the UX Team and Technical Architect and Front-End Senior Lead with responses sent back to the UX team and ultimately the Product Owner. Depending on how “Lean” you want to run the project this can be as lean as a rough sketch where the particulars are hashed out in the project to full-blown comps with requirement notes being captured in the Parent “Epic” Ticket. Initial talks of analytics should be talked about prompt the BL to reach out to the analytics team to establish this branch of the requirements.<br><br>When the receiving team is comfortable with the clarity of the intended product this phase will break down the ask into dispersible tickets. Depending on the skill and resources these tickets can be sized appropriately for the team. Basic Application Construction can start on day one considering the scaffolding is fundamental to any other work.<br><br>Independent work is brought together in this phase. It is common that co-working and JAD sessions occur in these tickets as team members bring together the individual efforts. There is no clean break of this phase to previous depending on the delivery it is common that a feature might go through all phases and be QA’d before other features are even started.<br><br><br>Design Phase is the most prone to change. This phase should be mostly completed before the rest of the tasks should start. There is always reason, technical or just iterating over an experience that can cause changes to the design but if the team has a good idea of what is being built and rework will be reduced. The tenants of AGILE does allow for iteration so it is inevitable that rework or alteration will happen. Documenting for the team should migrate to comments on design documents because living design documents are costly and in the end are a non-production artifact. It is very important that the Technology Team (DEV &amp; UI Lead) break down the steps and familiarize themselves with the nuances of the features to intelligently question the design and highlight possible issues before alterations become more impactful to the timelines. QA at this point can even scaffold out User Tests on features during this step.<br><br><br>Team review of the UX design of Project X. Highlight and Flag and Feasibility Changes and Iterate over them with the UX team. Team will submit a scaffolding of tickets to produce the Application. Details should include Data needs, Implementation Specifics, Analytics definitions, and Front-End Breakdown.<br><br><br>These steps are mostly dependent on the previous and could be collapsed to a single ticket but the ambiguity of the Data API it is best to keep these tickets into separate tickets to utilize a wider base of resources.<br><br><br>API &amp; Data Structures to support the application outline the data handshake and return results for App Build Team &amp; UI Team.<br><br>A user may only visit the URL if the user is logged in. The page will do all needed steps to redirect the user through log in in needed and redirect the user back to the page after success. Define URL &amp; create the hosting page in Sitecore.<br><br>A user should be able to visit a URL and have an application on that page respond to the visitor with the information it has available to it. Create the shell of the application and establish needed hooks to the data the application will know. This information is defined by the project but in the most basic definitions the application will know about the User, and possibly the URL and any query structures.<br><br>When the user visits the application, and it is loaded the application will initiate and collect information through API calls to store any data that is needed to display information and formulate any actions needed for the user defined by the project.<br><br><br>Components should follow the single tenant that they are only responsible for data passed to them and emitting their context. This separates concerns when the Application takes most of the features and components can stay agnostic.<br>When creating components all new components will be created with the library’s project folder. If the team finds value for a specific component that is generic enough to be reusable across many applications, the component can be promoted to a common library folder. Be aware that common components require a greater level of flexibility and scope to make them bullet proof for generic consumption.<br><br><br>Component tickets should encompass basic mutations that are needed for that component. Basic examples or mutations are Size, Location or Inclusion, Props (Data they will display), Validations, States, Etc. This should result in a Code Review and a Demo with UX Team and Product Owner. To reduce meeting overload, they can be grouped with other tickets or be deferred to the Feature Refinement Ticket<br><br><br>The user should be able to see the data they need to see and interact with data as defined by the requirements this is known as feature. In many cases features can be scaffolded with their data and methods without the need of utilizing components. Operations of an application like looping, reductions, additions, removals, data hooks and server responses can be all worked out without the use of components.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature. <br>For Example, “scaffold delete this line item from the list.” This will produce a data storage, list and methods and listeners that can be used to remove data from the list. This would also include any database API and deal with the response return updating the stored data of the list.<br><br><br>Inclusion of components and refinement of the frontend features. These phases will “wire” data and properties to components into the application. Depending on the size of the application these can be broken down into Features, or Pages, or States. This is the moment where components are due from the front-end teams. The deployment of components can be more staggered if the team is more comfortable with constant deployments. The benefits of this would be a lister would be available much earlier in the development process but may need to be updated or rewired if changes to validation or data needs alter in the refinement process.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature in the App<br>For Example, “A user by clicking on the delete button on a list item should delete it from the list.” Render a data list with the delete button. On the click add a listener to the application that will trigger the delete feature that has been scaffolded. QA this feature. Demo this Feature with UX Team and Product Owner.]]></description><link>work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/spa/outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/SPA/Outline of Tickets for SPAs in Vue.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Story First Content]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a>

And every piece of content should support, educate, or compel the user to act upon the task of the page. <br>Reduce - Reductive writing is best online users shy away from long blurbs of text.<br>
Reuse - Don't repeat similar or same blocks of text or content. If there are reasons for content to be used in multiple areas - link to it, or pattern it as a resource that users an engage with if they need it.<br>
Recycle- The title of the page you are linking to is usually not enough to be engaging. <br>
<br>Put the link within the text of the page,
<br>rewrite the hook to get users to the page by lifting up concepts and reasons for the user to engage with the link to navigate to it.
<br>Breaking a part the titles and content  so it is easier to scan. For Example Name of the doctor, concept of content, and type of content distinguished by style allows users to faster then it all written out as single line.

We should set high thresholds for what qualifies a topic or campaign for a separate microsite. Rather than creating a microsite, the default Generic Page approach should be utilized incorporated within the information architecture of our main site. Only when the content meets exceptionally stringent criteria—whether that's relevance, audience specificity, or uniqueness—should we consider the development of a standalone microsite.<br><br>
<br>
Specific Target Audience: Content needs to be tailored to a highly specific audience that can't be effectively targeted through the main site.

<br>
Unique Campaign: The content should pertain to a unique, typically time-bound campaign that requires distinct messaging separate from the broader brand or company offerings.    

<br>
SEO Strategy: The microsite should have a clear, separate SEO strategy focused on keywords and topics not covered by the main site.

<br>
User Experience: The microsite should offer a uniquely engaging user experience, such as an interactive product demo or immersive storytelling, that wouldn't fit well within the main site.

<br>
Unique Functional Requirements: The microsite should require functionality not supported or feasible on the main site, such as a unique user registration process, specific eCommerce setup, or API integrations.

<br><br>
<br>
New Product Launch: The content should relate to the launch of a new product or service that could benefit from focused attention and doesn't fit neatly into the existing site structure.

<br>
Event Promotion: The content should promote a specific event that warrants its own promotional and informational space.

<br>
Partnership or Collaboration: The microsite should be created for a joint venture, partnership, or collaboration with another entity, where separate branding and messaging is crucial.

<br>
Geographic Specificity: The microsite should cater to a specific geographic market that has unique needs separate from the main audience.

<br><br>
<br>Cost-Benefit Analysis: There should be a clear financial and strategic advantage to creating the microsite, with projected benefits outweighing the costs of development, maintenance, and potential dilution of brand or SEO.
<br>Defined Lifespan: Each microsite should have a defined lifespan, whether short-term or long-term. This timeframe should align with its strategic objectives, such as ongoing updates or serving as a reference resource. The expected lifespan should justify its creation and separate maintenance, ensuring it brings value during its entire existence.

Acting semi-independently from the main site, it caters to a niche audience or user need that benefits from a narrowed scope and tailored options, away from the broader offerings of the main site.<br>The microsite adopts the fundamental branding guidelines of ACC.org while introducing its unique design, structure, and organization. This concentration of tailored information and user actions makes it an effective tool for engagement.<br><br>
<br>Focused Content: Microsites allow you to create content that is highly targeted towards a specific audience or topic. This can help improve user engagement and conversion rates for that specific topic or audience.
<br>Product Brand Alterations: Microsites provide an opportunity to apply branding and design strategies unique to the product.  
<br>Campaign-Specific Messaging: Microsites can be an effective tool for unique marketing campaigns or product launches, where a dedicated site can deliver a focused message.
<br>Fast Deployment: Microsites can typically be augmented and launched more quickly than adding substantial new sections to an existing site. Most often this work is bespoke and one off.
<br>Flexibility: Microsites can be easily tweaked or shut down without affecting the rest of the company's web presence.
<br>User Experience: Microsites can offer a more streamlined and targeted user experience, leading to improved customer satisfaction and conversion rates for a product.
<br>Improved Tracking: It may be easier to track the effectiveness of a specific campaign or audience through a microsite, as analytics can be specifically tailored for the site.  
<br>Independence: If different departments or branches of a company want to maintain a certain level of autonomy in their web presence, microsites can offer this independence.
<br><br>While microsites can be valuable tools, they also come with inherent challenges that can affect your digital strategy. These challenges underline the fact that while microsites can be effective for specific initiatives, they should be used judiciously and with clear purpose, given the potential costs involved.<br>
<br>Brand Consistency: Operating multiple microsites can disrupt brand uniformity and recognition, causing customer confusion.
<br>Increased Management Complexity: The operation and maintenance of various microsites amplify the complexity of website management, requiring additional resources. The bespoke nature of the code might also lead to problems during system upgrades.
<br>SEO Risks: Microsites could cannibalize the SEO value of the main site and end up competing with it in search results.
<br>

<br>User Navigation and Context Confusion: Due to their distinctive branding and self-contained nature, microsites can create navigation challenges for users. Moving between multiple microsites and the main site can lead to a disorienting user experience. This context-switching confusion is typically less prevalent in a single, unified site of the main site.


<br>Content Duplication: Managing content across the main sites and isolated microsites introduces the risk of duplication and subsequent issues with content upkeep, maintenance  and SEO.
<br>Traffic Dilution: Traffic is dispersed across multiple microsites instead of being directed to one central site, leading to a dilution of traffic on the main site and less cross-site discovery.
<br>Discoverability: If not directly linked or referenced from the main site, microsites may be more difficult for users to find.
<br>Sustainability: Maintaining and updating numerous microsites over time can prove challenging, potentially resulting in outdated information.

Think of it as an independent information hub under the main site's umbrella, opening with a vibrant full-page introduction of its theme. Its content, organized in an exclusive structure of related sub-pages, enables users to delve deeper into the specific topic without other site distractions.<br>Microsites represent a calculated approach for presenting semi-independent projects. While they adhere to most of ACC.org's branding guidelines, their unique design and structure allow them to serve as focused resources for users.<br>However, creating a microsite is not always advisable due to costs and other considerations. It's generally reserved for significant initiatives that are notably important, brandable, unique, complex, and self-contained. In such instances, a microsite can offer significant value.

 <br>A microsite, also termed a landing page or brochure pages, is an independent yet integrative subsection within the main ACC.org framework. Though this division bears the basic branding of the main site, it introduces its unique sub-branding elements. These components establish a distinct identity, subtly differentiating the microsite while preserving coherence with the main brand. The structure of the microsite comprises multiple interconnected pages that form an exclusive navigation tree. This enclosed network ensures that each page links exclusively to other pages within the microsite, creating a tailored, immersive user journey. With a clearly defined central focus and goal, the microsite serves as a concentrated platform for strategic communication and user interaction.<br>TLDR Quick Read<br>

Each page is a chapter of the initiative's story, aimed to guide users to a strategically defined conversion point. Here's an outline of the elements:<br>
<br>Home of the Initiative: This main, full-screen page serves as the prologue to the initiative's story, providing a pathway back to the main ACC.org site. It features a text-free, richly layered hero image, a compelling call-to-action (CTA), and supportive information to propel the narrative. Additional CTAs invite visitors to explore further details.  

<br>Hero Image: This visually arresting image, free from text and easily adaptable to cropping or trimming, imbues the microsite with a unique "flair" or brand identity. <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Hero Image with CTA" data-href="Hero Image with CTA" href="work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/components/hero-image-with-cta.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Hero Image Requirement</a>
<br>Initiative CTA and Hero Image: The microsite distinguishes itself from the main ACC.org site through its unique branding, represented by the hero image and a clear, persuasive CTA. This combination piques user interest and encourages action.


<br>Sub-Pages and Micro Branding: Consistent branding is carried through to each sub-page via a smaller image that reflects the "flair" of the home page's hero image. These pages, adhering to comprehensive content creation guidance, utilize a sidebar navigation layout and always lead back to the "Home of the Initiative". <a data-href="Micro Branding with Page Title" href="work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/components/micro-branding-with-page-title.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Micro Branding with Page Title</a>

<br>Purpose-Driven Sub-Pages and Conversion Points: Every sub-page plays a crucial role in the initiative's narrative, either by presenting a primary CTA, providing deeper information, or hosting a set of conversion points. Each page aims to drive the user towards a conversion, fulfilling the strategic needs of the microsite.


<br>This well-crafted design ensures a distinct, narrative-driven user experience within the microsite while maintaining a strong link to the broader ACC.org environment.<br><a href=".?query=tag:acc/guidance" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/guidance</a> <a href=".?query=tag:acc/org/microsite" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/org/microsite</a> ]]></description><link>work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/microsites/anatomy-of-a-microsite.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/Microsites/Anatomy of a Microsite.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Full Page Splashes]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:checklist" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#checklist</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a> 
 <br>Full Page Splashes,  orphan pages, or  marketing landing pages are isolated pages within our website's architecture that are not linked from the homepage and should be used sparingly and strategically. These pages exist outside of our website's primary navigation and can inadvertently disrupt a user's browsing experience. As a rule, these pages should only be created in specific scenarios - such as part of a well-defined marketing campaign with a predetermined lifespan.<br><br>Before implementing a Full Page Splash, ensure all of the following criteria are met:<br>
<br>The page is directly tied to a specific marketing campaign. <a href=".?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a> 
<br>The page has a limited lifespan with a clearly established takedown date. <a href=".?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a> 
<br>The page is structured within the Sitecore folder, specifically under Parent of Main Branch/features. <a href=".?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a> 
<br>The content is succinct enough to fit on a single page without overwhelming the user. <a href=".?query=tag:checklist" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#checklist</a>

 <br>Email Marketing<br>Here’s a streamlined process flow for utilizing Direct Marketing Emails, Social Posts, and Web Marketing to drive users to landing pages with single goal CTAs, optimizing for conversion:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240924173228.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png"><br><br>
<br>Objective: Whether the goal is membership sign-up, promoting a specific product, or encouraging course enrollment, start with a clear and single-focused goal.<br>

<br>Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173258.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173258.png"><br><br>
<br>Personalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient.<br>

<br>Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product.<br>

<br>Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links.

<br>Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button.<br>



<br>Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173344.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173344.png"><br><br>
<br>Awareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly.<br>

<br>Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”.<br>

<br>Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement.<br>

<br>Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page.<br>

<br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click.
  <img alt="Pasted image 20240924173411.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173411.png">
<br><br>
<br>Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment).<br>

<br><br>
<br>Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's "Join Now", "Sign Up", or "Purchase". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal.<br>

<br>Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience.<br>

<br>Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”).<br>

<br>Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173440.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173440.png"><br><br>
<br>Track Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions.<br>

<br>Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency.<br>

<br>Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips).<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173458.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173458.png"><br><br>
<br>
Direct Email:

<br>Send an email to non-members emphasizing the value of membership (e.g., “Unlock exclusive access to resources, discounts, and courses”).<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to membership sign-up landing page.<br>



<br>
Social Media Post:

<br>Post a testimonial or success story from a current member, emphasizing the benefits.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Learn More” → Redirect to landing page that further explains membership benefits.<br>



<br>
Website Banner Ad:

<br>Place a banner on relevant blog or content pages: “Become a Member Today and Get Access to Premium Courses”.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to landing page optimized for membership sign-ups.<br>



<br>By focusing on single-action CTAs, and maintaining consistent, clear messaging across all communication channels, this process maximizes the chances of conversion from email, social, and web marketing efforts.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173524.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173524.png">]]></description><link>work/acc/projects/hubspot-landing-page/maximize-conversions-with-integrated-marketing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/HubSpot Landing Page/Maximize Conversions with Integrated Marketing.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 23:54:42 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Page List]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Tip: Add humorous or lighthearted content to ease frustration.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Display a clear message explaining the request was incorrect or malformed. Suggest actions the user can take, such as reloading the page or checking for errors in the URL.

<br>Track Errors for Improvement: Log and monitor these error codes to identify recurring issues and improve site performance over time.

 <br>Backlog Ticket: Article "Children Renderings" Conversion to Arches<br>
<br>
Title: Convert Article Subtypes to Arches Format

<br>
Description:

<br>Background: Currently, the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes are not compatible with our ARCHES system. These subtypes include ClinicalTrial, GuidelineHub, JournalScan, PressRelease, Recommendation, TenPoints, and potentially others not listed.
<br>Objective: To successfully convert the "children renderings" of articles into the ARCHES format, ensuring seamless integration with the CMS and maintaining consistency across ACC platforms.
<br>User Story: As a developer, I want to convert the Sitecore renderings for article subtypes into the ARCHES format, so that articles can be more efficiently managed and displayed across ACC's digital platforms.


<br>
Acceptance Criteria:

<br>A working version of all article children types is established in a local environment.
<br>The conversion of all identified children renderings into the ARCHES format is completed.
<br>Ensure that the new ARCHES renderings are fully functional and compatible with existing CMS infrastructure.
<br>Maintain visual and functional consistency with the overall design and layout standards of ACC platforms.
<br>The conversion process and final output should be documented for future reference and maintenance.
<br>The conversion should be completed without causing any downtime or disruption to live services.


<br>
Dependencies: 

<br>The ticket depends on the successful setup of a local development environment for the joint development effort.
<br>This ticket blocks the work for <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.atlassian.net/browse/APPSUPPORT-22095" target="_blank">APPSUPPORT-22095</a>.
<br>Coordination with the team members (Ling, Matt, Rowena, Jacob, and ASP Dev) for a 3-hour joint development meeting is crucial.


<br>
Notes for Joint Development Meeting:

<br>Confirm attendance and availability of all required team members.
<br>Ensure all necessary tools and resources are accessible during the meeting.
<br>Set clear objectives for the meeting to maximize productivity.
<br>Allocate time for discussion, development, and troubleshooting.

<br>Intro
<br>How We Investigated the Problem

<br>Website Audits at Multiple Focused Levels: Content, Member Section Deep Dive, and UX Analysis

<br>Multi layered investigations have been done against this section of content




<br>Cutting the Fat &amp; Taking out the Trash

<br>Website Content Audit We have discovered obsolete pages and reduces the content and value that we need to cater to.

<br>Enforcing a new pattern for content production to reduce the repeat of this issue in the future. Doc Matter will take on some of content that once lived here. 
<br>The  content that is left in this zone will be more aggressively archived to reduce regaining bloat. 




<br>Dealing with the Customer Experience

<br>The Member Section Deep Dive has found the inconsistency has lead to a confused customer experience. Has lead to maintenance problems which as drained resources over the years stopping us from improving this facet of the Member Benefits to its fullest. Optimizing and simplifying can open up time and effort to really drive content and facilitation to return value back to the members.

<br>Structure Becomes the Same
<br>Content Channels become easier to follow
<br>Cross Usage and onboarding becomes simplified in messaging and action




<br>Reinforcing Value to Member Sections

<br>Member Section as a value exclusive access to tailored resources, mentorship, and leadership opportunities within specialized communities, helping professionals advance their careers, build credibility, and stay connected to the latest developments in their field.

<br>Access to Exclusive Content comes with putting the content behind a need to login. 

<br>This can open up future opportunities to enrich this content from conversations started in Doc Matter and through Workgroup Polish made into valuable resources and toolkits specific to these member sections


<br>Specialized Gated Digital Communities of Doc Matter established areas to start mentorship, and leadership opportunities
<br>Linking Globally Published Content builds Nontreaty and Visibility of the Section




<br>How does this work in the real world -

<br>Prototype Example.

 <br>Here are all four personas, incorporating the updated preferences:<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Emma Wright  

<br>
Demographics: 42, Cardiologist, Busy Practitioner  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
Emma frequently visits the member section but rarely interacts. She uses the platform to gain exposure to new ideas and practices outside the confines of her immediate professional environment. Though she doesn't contribute to discussions, she values the ability to access diverse perspectives and knowledge that she might not encounter in her day-to-day practice.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Access to a broader range of insights and innovations outside her specialized work environment  
<br>Exposure to emerging trends and interdisciplinary practices without the pressure to engage  
<br>Staying up-to-date on best practices in cardiovascular care across a wide professional spectrum


<br>

<br>Encouraging passive participation through features like recommended reading based on emerging trends  
<br>Exposure to discussions and webinars that broaden her view outside her regular practice area


<br><br><br>
<br>

<br>
Demographics: 34, Nurse Practitioner, Cardiovascular Specialty  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
David sees the member section as a much-needed space where he can connect with like-minded professionals who share his focus on cardiovascular care. In his current professional environment, he often feels isolated due to the niche nature of his specialty. The member section provides him with a sense of belonging, allowing him to engage in meaningful discussions, contribute his expertise, and exchange ideas with others who understand his field.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Building connections with professionals who share his specialty and interests  
<br>Participating in discussions and sharing his experiences to contribute to the collective knowledge of his "tribe"

<br>Difficulty finding deeper engagement in discussions that go beyond surface-level topics


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Dedicated spaces or groups within the platform that focus specifically on his specialty, fostering a "tribe" mentality  
<br>Opportunities for collaboration on case studies or joint projects with other specialists  
<br>Recognition for contributing to niche discussions, further building a sense of community and validation


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Lisa Patel  

<br>
Demographics: 48, Physician Assistant, Balancing Multiple Roles  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>
Lisa uses the member section to break free from the professional silos of her work. When she engages, she actively seeks out networking opportunities with peers from diverse backgrounds. These connections help her gain insights and ideas outside the boundaries of her current professional setting. Her engagement comes in bursts, focused primarily on meeting new people and exchanging knowledge.

<br>
Motivations:  

<br>Networking with professionals from various specialties to broaden her perspective  
<br>Engaging with peers to exchange innovative ideas and learn from different fields  
<br>Building relationships that provide exposure to new methods, outside of her regular clinical environment


<br>
Frustrations:  

<br>Difficulty maintaining new contacts and finding ongoing opportunities to interact  
<br>Feels her access to new ideas is limited during inactive periods, making her engagement feel sporadic and siloed


<br>
Opportunities for Engagement:  

<br>Networking events or peer-matching features that introduce her to professionals from outside her usual circles  
<br>Opportunities to connect with members who share interdisciplinary expertise and experiences  
<br>Features to maintain relationships, such as saved connections or discussion prompts that encourage ongoing dialogue


<br><br><br>
<br>
Name: Dr. Marcus Johnson  

<br>
Demographics: 55, Senior Cardiologist, Thought Leader  

<br>
Engagement Style:<br>

<br>Lacks advanced tools for proposing or implementing changes to the website structure and content curation


<br>

At every step, we want to showcase to users what they are missing out on. We intend to reward the users by opening up specialized areas in Docmatter and curating exclusive content behind the access walls.<br><br>Let's dive into some of the details. When talking about onboarding, we want to consider 4 user states: ​<br>
<br>LOGGED OUT
<br>NOT A MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE
<br>A MEMBER WHO DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SECTION
<br>A USER WITH FULL ACCESS.​
<br>​<br>These personalization hooks give us the flexibility to craft the experience, allowing for better instructions and selling tactics.<br>Only users of a specific state are shown the&nbsp;next steps in their personalized journey. ​ This allows us to craft the upsell and instructions to Membership for example or the Member Section when the time is appropriate.<br><br>Now that the onboarding process has become simplified in messaging and action, we can discuss how our users are often part of more than one section. To reduce mental friction when moving from one section to another, we want to strongly enforce consistency.​  This consistency can been seen in the design pattern, the layouts and more importantly the labels and page structures. <br>​<br>
This will allow our multifaceted members to experience an organized environment so they can focus on the content rather than where it was labeled or placed. An added benefit is that when new features are rolled out, they are easier to discover.​<br><br>Personalization will not be added to just the main page. The content zones of sections will also showcase content at different levels keyed to the user's access. This can showcase the quality of materials and enforce a desire to gain full access to this quality content.]]></description><link>work/acc/projects/acc-redesign/member-sections-presentation-script.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Member Sections Presentation Script.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 13 Dec 2024 20:35:38 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Project Summary]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>
<br>Ensure the site provides immediate feedback for user actions, such as logging in, submitting forms, or loading pages, so users know their actions are being processed.
<br><br>
<br>The content and navigation should use terms and language that resonate with your audience (e.g., "My Courses," "Membership Dashboard," "Explore Articles") to make the site intuitive.
<br><br>
<br>Users should be able to easily navigate between sections, undo actions, and go back without confusion, especially when managing membership details or course enrollments.
<br><br>
<br>The design, layout, and labeling should remain consistent across the site, whether users are in the membership area, reading articles, or accessing educational content.
<br><br>
<br>Provide users with clear, guided steps to minimize mistakes, particularly in processes like signing up for a membership, enrolling in a course, or making a purchase.
<br><br>
<br>Reduce the need for users to remember details by displaying key information clearly, such as membership status, progress in courses, and recommended articles.
<br><br>
<br>Design for both new and experienced users, allowing shortcuts and advanced features (like filtering or bookmarking) for members who visit frequently while keeping it simple for new visitors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that pages are visually simple and easy to navigate, focusing on the most important actions like reading articles, accessing courses, or checking membership benefits.
<br><br>
<br>If something goes wrong, provide a clear explanation and actionable steps to resolve the issue, such as payment problems or content loading errors.
<br><br>
<br>Ensure that users can quickly find help through FAQs, support articles, or a contact option, especially when they are having trouble with their membership, accessing courses, or reading content.

 <br><br>
<br>Hard to find
<br>Slow to load
<br>Not up to date
<br>Login 
<br>Product Life Cycle from a user point of view (buy, use, renew, extract credits)
<br><br>
<br>How useful is the Main Nav (Clinical Topics)
<br>Latest in Cardiology (Doesn't Mean anything it is a junk drawer)
<br>how useful is  Search on Site if everyone is using google
<br>Lack of enforcement of member value with out pay wall. 
<br>Personalization - Give value to login in!!!!
<br>Content is written a dated and not directed way when dealing with brochureware, products any that is not science

<br>We speak to everyone which means our voice is not compelling to anyone.


<br>Not Mobile Friendly
<br>Duplicative Content (Confusing for users and a drain on resources)

<br>Articles, Content, Products, and Derivatives
<br>Confusing "Like" Products.

<br>CCKE
<br>Webinar vs Online Course
<br>Key Points vs Top Ten
<br>ASCVD RISK (Apps, Excel, CardioSmart HHRC, tools.acc.org )




<br>Not Accessible 

<br>Structure Aria
<br>Brand Color Issues
<br>Image Usage with Text
<br>SEM/SEO
<br>Find-ability
<br>Promotion
<br>STRUCTURED Data &amp; Content
<br>Analytics Funneling


<br>No clear division between Enterprise Domains.

<br>Clear Usage, Focus of Efforts, Reasons to Deploy within each Domain. 

<br>Why should something be found in JACC and not ACC or CardioSmart. 




<br>Central Login with our Family of Products. 

<br>Cross walking our Enterprise is a jarring. 


<br>No structural plans for how to scale content onto the site. 
<br>Disjointed implementation of Design. (Lack of Creative Direction Enforcement) 

<br>Need ACC to have enough built out so we don't run into "it needs to be NEW UI"
<br>Need a process to "Accept new UI"
<br>Need to know who and what is being built so we can police it. (UX and CS)
<br>Need the power to enforce. We can be overruled.


<br>Maintenance Issue (slow to fix, slow to change)

<br>Resources limitations causes errors and fixes to languish for weeks to even years.

<br>Grid Box Error
<br>Membership Section Announcements
<br>SWG improvements
<br>Arches Conversion
<br>Forsee errors should make a jira hot fix.




<br>Pain Points are training users to alter their behavior. 

<br>Mobile is painful so they use desktops
<br>Purchased Product Entry Points are hard to find so users go back to the original purchase page
<br>Nothing changes when I login so why should I.
<br>Science is hard to find so they go somewhere else....


<br>Load Times

<br>Optimization of Code, Loaded Content to Page, Slow to Paint Page.  

<br>Still looking at 4-6 seconds to load official standard of the web is .1




<br>Back End Editing is Painful

<br>Components are hard to find, organization is confused and mixed with legacy and arches and never use.
<br>Components need a combination of Experience Editor and Detail View
<br>SiteCore likes to alter and "lint" html between Source and WYSIWYG
<br>I don't know if this is a sitecore problem or an us problem.


<br>No real way to test (from a base setup)

<br>A/B
<br>Funnel Tracking 


<br>We have branching pages that give no value besides wiring the pages together
<br>Orphan Pages from the site experience
<br>FIX All Foresee Bugs
<br>Phase 2 and Maintenance is a Unicorn.

<br>Changes are are jarring
<br>Consistency is good
<br>New experience is always hated by someone
<br>What is the scope of the Redesign. Are we just starting over? are we keeping with best patterns and applying consistency? Are we just removing the dead weight and fixing problems?

 <br><br>To effectively explore our competitive landscape, this survey aimed to uncover both direct and indirect competition regarding features and benefits offered by ACC.org. While direct comparison against our field is valuable, we should also consider how we compete on features and user experience beyond the cardiovascular care space.

 <br><br>This is an audit of the two Product Pages that currently have overlapping content. Below is a numbered list of the two pages, and how they will be referred to thereafter:<br>
<br>Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S.:<br>
a. Referred to as CVTeam.
<br>Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S.:<br>
a. Referred to as Clinician-OUS.
<br>The two pages—"CVTEAM" and "Clinician-OUS"—contain significant overlap and some type-specific content. The recommendations below aim to streamline and unify both pages for clarity and ease of navigation for users. Content can be categorized into three groups: identical, very similar, and type-specific. The goal is to consolidate identical content, modify the similar content to fit both groups where applicable, and keep type-specific information targeted to the specific audience.<br><br>
<br>
Unify Duplicate Sections: Many sections across both pages have the same or nearly identical content, such as "How Will the Exam be Administered?", "What is the Reliability of This Exam?", and "What Topics Are Included on This Exam?". Consolidate these into one central resource (such as a FAQ) that is shared between both audiences.

<br>
Keep Persona-Specific Details Separate: Type-specific content should be kept separate where necessary to ensure that information remains relevant and directly applicable to each audience, e.g., "Who's Eligible to Take ACC's Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE)?" where eligibility criteria differ for NPs/PAs versus physicians.

<br>
Create Cross-References to Simplify Navigation: Provide hyperlinks between shared sections and persona-specific pages to make it easier for users to navigate between general and specific content. This will improve the overall user journey by reducing the likelihood of confusion between similar content.

<br><br><br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241030170446.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20241030170446.png"><br>The proposed AI structure helps streamline the content by focusing each page's role to enhance user experience, reduce redundancy, and provide clear navigation pathways even when users arrive at the wrong page variant.<br>
<br>Product Page: Centralizes key exam-related content, making it the first point of reference for all users. It focuses on eligibility, application processes, exam administration, and a general overview, ensuring consistency and reducing noise by keeping shared content unified.
<br>Persona Detail Pages: Targeted at specific roles, these pages provide tailored details for eligibility, exam dates, preparation resources, and other specifics. By keeping type-specific information on dedicated pages, users can easily navigate to content relevant to their background without sifting through unrelated details.
<br>FAQ Page: Acts as a shared resource for questions that apply to both personas. This page will address common concerns, minimizing redundancy and providing a quick, centralized place for users to find general information. Hyperlinks will be used to direct users to persona-specific details where necessary.
<br>This structure is designed to help users who might have arrived at the wrong variant by guiding them to the right section, thus reducing user frustration and improving satisfaction.<br><br>Consolidation of Identical and Very Similar Content: Move sections that are largely duplicated to a shared FAQ or product page. These sections include "How Will the Exam be Administered?", "What is the Reliability of This Exam?", and "Does the CCKE Offer a Credential?" Doing so will help reduce maintenance efforts while also improving consistency for users.<br>
<br>
Maintaining Persona-Specific Content: For sections that are specific to either "Clinician-OUS" or "CVTeam," create separate Persona Detail Pages. For instance, eligibility requirements, submission details, and exam dates vary between the two audiences. Keeping these sections separate but cross-referencing shared content will reduce confusion while allowing both pages to provide specialized information.

<br>
Use of Accordion Components: Keep the collapsible accordion structure to allow users to access content in manageable portions, making the pages less overwhelming. Ensure that each accordion component has consistent headings and styles across both "CVTeam" and "Clinician-OUS" pages.

<br>
Navigation Enhancements: To further reduce confusion, provide clear links at the end of shared sections like "How Much Does This Exam Cost?" to direct users to persona-specific details.

<br><br>If the two products cannot be merged, it is recommended to rebrand one or both products to ensure they are distinguishable and reduce confusion. The proposed rebranding involves the following:<br>
<br>
Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S. (CVTeam): 

<br>Maintain existing branding, but emphasize that this version of the exam is specifically for U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants.


<br>
Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S. (Clinician-OUS):

<br>Rebrand this product to differentiate it more clearly from CVTeam. Consider adding a geographic or professional distinction to the name, such as "International Cardiovascular Knowledge Certification" or "Certified Cardiovascular Competence for International Physicians".


<br>
Visual and Structural Distinction:

<br>Introduce distinct color schemes or visual markers on both product pages to signal the difference at a glance.
<br>Update headers and footers to clearly mention the audience for each product, e.g., "For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S." vs. "For U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants".


<br>
Clarify Naming Across All Communications:

<br>Update all marketing, email, and support documentation to ensure that users are consistently seeing the rebranded names.
<br>Ensure that cross-references between the products are explicit about the intended audience to avoid any ambiguity.


<br>The goal of the rebranding effort is to reduce confusion, particularly among members who may be unsure which certification is appropriate for their professional background. By creating a stronger distinction between the two certifications, ACC can improve user satisfaction and reduce the potential for misapplication.]]></description><link>work/acc/projects/ccke/ccke-content-proposal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/CCKE/CCKE Content Proposal.md</guid><pubDate>Fri, 01 Nov 2024 19:02:25 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/pasted-image-20241030170446.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib/media/pasted-image-20241030170446.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Project Summary]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>The Hero Image on the homepage will now support an optional overlay button. This button will be configurable by content editors, allowing them to set the URL, text, style (primary or secondary), and position on the image based on different breakpoints (phone, small tablet, large tablet, and desktop).<br>Scope of the Feature:<br>
<br>If there is no URL and Label included in the configuration of the component the hero image area will not be clickable and the render will not render any button UI.
<br>It is MarComs responsibility to deliver an images in the correct size and dimensions with non critical information in the area where the button will be positioned.

<br>Sizes: 300x350, 600x300,900x300,1200x400
<br>Accepted images are PNG, JPG


<br>You can only choose 1 button position, style, URL, and label for all break points.
<br>The entire area of the Positioning grid will be clickable and cause the button to hover.
<br>The cards part of the feature will also will have their click box expanded to their entire area.
<br>Acceptance Criteria:<br>
<br>Button Configuration Options:

<br>URL: Editors can input the target URL for the button. This URL if empty and the Label is included should default to About-ACC URL
<br>Label: Editors can input the display text for the button.
<br>Style:

<br>Primary Button: Teal blue with white text.
<br>Secondary Button: Light grey with black text.
<br>ACC Brand Button: ACC Blue with white text
<br>ACC Brand Reversed: White with ACC Blue Text


<br>Position:

<br>Options: 'Left', 'Center', and 'Right'.
<br>Position varies depending on the breakpoint (refer to the "Button Position Based on Breakpoint" section below).




<br>Button Position Based on Breakpoint:

<br>Button Positioning Grid:

<br>the Grid inset is 0 0 60px 0 to the full width and eight of the image.
<br>1 rem padding from the edge of its inset image.
<br>The hit area of the image should be the entire area.


<br>Phone:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 4 (height)
<br>Button should size down one step from normal.
<br>Uploaded Size: 300w x 350h
<br>Grid Layout: 1 column x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Regardless of 'Left', 'Center', or 'Right' setting, the button will be centered in the bottom row.




<br>Small Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 2 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 600w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 2 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Large Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 900w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Desktop:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 1200w x 400h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell of the last row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.






<br>Responsive Behavior:

<br>The button's position and size should adjust dynamically based on the device's screen size and aspect ratio.
<br>The button should not overlap important text or imagery unless specified in the design guidelines.<br>
( this will be the responsibility of theMarCom to not place critical information in the art in the areas they selected for the button placement. )


<br>Editor Preview:

<br>Provide a preview in the CMS where editors can see how the button will look on different breakpoints before publishing.


<br>QA Testing Notes:<br>
<br>Test button configuration for all breakpoints.
<br>Validate button positioning aligns with the specified grid layouts.
<br>Verify that styling changes correctly based on editor selection.
<br>Test keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility.
<br>Design Reference:<br>

 <br>Frontend development continues to expand as a percentage of project coding to the point that some of our products, such as the clinical applications, are 100% frontend code. Over the past year, I have been putting work together to support a massive shift in how we do frontend and, in the long run, how we develop, support, and release our college software solutions.&nbsp;<br>The most significant issue I continually see in IT is decentralized coding efforts. Decentralization leads to repetitive solutions, inconsistent behaviors, extended regression testing, bloated packages, complicated deployments, and potential code errors as we try to make security patches or upgrades.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Focusing on improving how we execute frontend for the college and not just for a project, I have tackled four pillars.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<br>Unification of design but building for flexibility
<br>Shifting to the CFD (component first development )
<br>Creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored
<br>Centralizing everything for everyone
<br>The unification of design was the first place I started. "Arches" is the current solution that enforces a Design Opps procedure to streamline requests and deliver a college-wide design system. This design system has two tenants. First, it can replicate its styles influenced by the brand and frameworks from its product space. It now covers QII, ACC, Cardiosmart, and Mobile and can be further scaled. Second is its utility framework that ensures a highly flexible practice to allow countless UI permutations without CSS mutations. Utility styling is also known as "scopeless" styling because you can build out many UI patterns without ever altering the original styles.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br><a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/" target="_blank">https://assets.acc.org/Arches/Latest/docs/</a><br>Shifting to CFD (component first development) embraces an architecture for our frontend products and alters how we develop. CFD, as a pattern, has been around since 2012 with bootstrap. In its infancy, CFD could only capture minor token UI. Still, with the introduction of javascript models like Web Components, React, Vue CFD can now capture business logic, complicated interface interactions, and data mutations. Vue has been my primary focus as it builds on the collective knowledge of the department. Vue has the capabilities to make obsolete Jquery UI, Pager, Knockout, Angular, JqueryMobile, and many other libraries that are currently in use. IT streamlining to a single dependency allows for universal software patching for frontend security issues.&nbsp;<br>Currently, we are creating documentation that is utilized and not just ignored. As we shift to CFD, we can use Storybook which allows for documentation around a living singular component with artificial data. This type of documentation gives a single point of Design, Development, and QA. The effort on a single element can be attached to countless projects through version control. Centralized development and QA can give us a feasible path to automated unit testing and regression testing. As new projects come online, utilizing the global-version-controlled components would benefit from standards, consistency, and quality control. Preliminary work done with Storybook around a future product under the ACC.org "Home Page Redesign." Projects could include the transcript, CSTool, GL Search, Coveo Search, and FIT Management. <br>Vue 2 component for reference<br>

I have conversations  GM, Josh G, and Micheal M, and the great work of Ling C on creating a path forward with using assets.acc.org and also moving the newly used submodule features from GIT  within current and future products. Submodules empower the component work to be checked in and out from both the centralized-version-control and from projects, these efforts can be kept in sync. The vision for this project is to be controlled by ACC but utilizable by vendors.  ]]></description><link>work/acc/arches/front-end-design-at-the-college.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Front End Design at the College.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Design System]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc/design" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/design</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc/arches" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/arches</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a>

 <br>The process of bulk conversion is a nuanced operation that significantly depends on the scope of the pages being converted. Each bulk conversion task is unique, and while insights and learnings from previous conversions inform the process, it's important to note that a bespoke report is produced after each conversion. This report, presented in an Excel document, is a crucial tool that outlines the User Interface (UI) items within the editorial scope - including Rich Text and Custom Scripts - that require remediation following the conversion. The items are neatly categorized by sheet, each containing the Item ID, URL, and proposed remediation notes. This systematic approach provides a comprehensive view of the areas within the CMS that may need review, adjustments, or those indicating a potential function failure. Typical remediation steps include actions like "let fail," "add classes," "remove," and "replace with components," but this list is not exhaustive. If more complex actions are needed, additional notes may be added for clarity. This meticulous process ensures an efficient and methodical approach to addressing changes and potential issues post-conversion.<br><br>A listing of all pages effected by the conversion<br><br><br>]]></description><link>work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/editorial-bulk-change-notice-excel.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Audit of Editorial UI]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Over time, the content areas of our CMS have seen the implementation of various User Interface (UI) solutions. Often grassroots in origin, these Editorially Created UI elements, composed of inline styles, in-page styles, and JavaScript, present considerable maintenance and update challenges.<br>To manage this tech debt, our bulk conversion process aims to remediate or remove these elements. The goal is to align our UI with the Arches Enterprise Design System, which entails eliminating non-conforming in-page JavaScript and Styles.<br>To facilitate this, we're conducting an audit of the Editorially Created UI components. This audit plays a crucial role in forming a plan that ensures website functionality while addressing unnecessary complexity.<br><br>This process involves a meticulous examination and subsequent remediation of all editorially integrated links - a prerequisite before launching any audit. Our audit also thoroughly reviews content areas embedded with script and style blocks. Particular attention is given to the returned content scrape, which is systematically converted into a Unicode format that's safe for coding.<br>As part of this procedure, we identify and replace certain patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their equivalent symbols, and transform specific HTML entity codes into spaces and carriage returns, thereby improving block readability. This method allows the team to evaluate readable blocks effectively and discover any "new" patterns, which aids in documenting necessary remediation steps. This systematic approach prepares us for the eventual removal of style and script blocks, creating the necessary tickets or steps as required.<br>Numbered Steps:<br>
<br>Begin by running the remediation of all editorially included links that are set to "Save" before initiating the audit.
<br>Perform an <a data-href="#Audit Report" href="about:blank#Audit_Report" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Audit Report</a> of content areas that contain script and style blocks on the page.
<br>Ensure the returned content scrap is converted into a code-safe Unicode because of the <a data-href="#Content Scrape Limitations" href="about:blank#Content_Scrape_Limitations" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Content Scrape Limitations</a>.
<br>Identify and replace specific patterns, such as "&lt;" and "&gt;", with their corresponding symbols.
<br>Substitute certain HTML entity codes into space and transform others into carriage returns.
<br>Evaluate the now readable blocks after the aforementioned transformations.
<br>Discover any new patterns that emerge from the evaluation, and document the appropriate <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Remediation" data-href="Remediation" href="work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/remediation.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">remediation steps</a>.
<br>Finally, create any necessary tickets or steps to prepare for the obliteration of style and script blocks.
<br><br><br><br>To make the code more readable, it's crucial to replace certain Unicode characters with their typical representations. Specifically, we'll be dealing with the following conversions:<br>
<br>The Unicode for the carriage return, _000D_, should be replaced with a visual marker for carriage returns such as the symbol "↵".
<br>The Unicode for the horizontal tab, _0009_, could be replaced with a few spaces for better visualization.
<br>The Unicode for the space, _0020_, can be substituted with a visible space character.
<br>The line feed character, represented by the Unicode _000A_, can be swapped with a new line symbol like "␤" to depict line breaks better.
<br>The tab character, also represented by _0009_, should be replaced with a few spaces for clarity.
<br>Finally, the Unicode for less than and greater than symbols, &amp;lt; and &amp;gt;, can be converted to their actual "&lt;" and "&gt;" symbols.
<br>By transforming these Unicode characters into their corresponding visual representations, we significantly enhance the comprehensibility of the document, thus facilitating easier identification of different elements and their spacing.]]></description><link>work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Process/Excel/Audit of Editorial UI.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Script Process]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc/arches/conversion" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/arches/conversion</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:acc/guidance" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#acc/guidance</a>

<br>Option 1: Set content items to a DRAFT status when converting content in Author.&nbsp; See Sitecore DRAFT workflow doc&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Possible risk is the Original Posted Date may be updated as a result (need confirmation)&nbsp;
<br>Option 2: -- TBD&nbsp;


<br>
IT to perform spot checks in Author to ensure the conversion script was completed successfully.&nbsp;

<br>
BL reviews converted pages in Author and as pages are validated, publish in increments (as appropriate)&nbsp;

<br>UI, DEV, &amp; QA teams on standby to field any questions or address any concerns&nbsp;




<br>
Post Conversion/Clean Up Tasks&nbsp;(once all batches are complete, one-time task)&nbsp;

<br>Once conversion is complete, we will take the Arches presentations and merge them into the current legacy template presentation configurations, and delete the Arches versions, as clean up.&nbsp;


<br>QA Approach (DRAFT)&nbsp;<br>NOTE: This approach should be visited as we progress w/ the batches.&nbsp; Also, scheduled sprint content syncs should not adversely affect the Arches QA pages since they will already exist prior to the content sync.&nbsp;<br>
<br>UI/UX team will create an Arches QA dedicated page (e.g., page name to include '_ArchesQA' suffix&nbsp; in the DEV environment in support of their development &amp; verification process.&nbsp;
<br>Once the component updates have been verified in the DEV environment, UI/UX to request a Razl content sync to SPR in coordination w/ their updates getting built and deployed to SPR. (Ricky can assist w/ Razl syncs)&nbsp;
<br>QA will then use the Arches QA dedicated page in SPR to test the target components.&nbsp; Once validated in SPR, QA will work with DEV (Ricky) to sync content to upper environments (STG/RLS) as the changes are promoted.&nbsp;
<br>PRD deployment (e.g., pre-task) should include a step to sync the Arches QA dedicated page to PRD (Author ONLY, do not publish to Delivery) in order for QA validate in PRD.&nbsp;
<br>Once validated, need to ensure there is a clean-up process to remove/delete QA dedicated pages, once ready (in ALL environments)&nbsp;
<br>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It is important that we have a way to roll back our work at any point throughout these cycles and we need to be able to do this in a way that BL can be comfortable with. This plan doesn’t really account for if something goes pear shaped in Sprint C but we should probably iron that out as well, especially if something goes wrong during the push to production.&nbsp;<br>This looks like a three-sprint process, but we may be able to consider identifying the next batch during sprint C to speed up conversion if necessary.<br><a href=".?query=tag:acc/arches" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/arches</a> <a href=".?query=tag:acc/arches/conversion" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/arches/conversion</a> <a href=".?query=tag:acc/guidance" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#acc/guidance</a> <br>Metadata

 <br>&nbsp;I want to outline a comprehensive Knowledge Transfer (KT) strategy that targets the required remediation steps. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition, allowing our team to manage the work systematically and avoid overwhelming our team resources and capabilities.&nbsp;<br>Here's a step-by-step process to guide our KT activities:<br>Sub-dividing the Conversion into Manageable Segments:&nbsp;We can accomplish tasks efficiently throughout the week by dividing the bulk conversion into themed work or manageable segments. For instance, focusing on a specific aspect like "all the pages that have tabs" will make the process more digestible and actionable.<br>Weekly Kick-off Meeting for Conversion Blocks:&nbsp;At the start of the week, we will convene a meeting where a conversion block of pages is presented. This meeting will include a live demo showing how to make the necessary changes, providing an excellent opportunity for team members to understand the process firsthand.<br>Standing 30-Minute Meetings throughout the Week:&nbsp;To ensure continuous support and clear communication, I suggest scheduling a standing 30-minute meeting every day. This stand-up meeting will be a forum to discuss any roadblocks or questions related to the assigned work. It will enable real-time problem-solving and maintain momentum in the project.<br>Here’s a high-level schedule to illustrate the flow:<br>Monday:&nbsp;Kick-off meeting with a conversion demo for the week's segment (e.g., pages with tabs).<br>Tuesday to Friday:&nbsp;Daily 30-minute stand-up sessions to address questions and roadblocks.<br>End of Week:&nbsp;Recap and assessment of the week's accomplishments, planning for the next segment.<br>By adhering to this process, we aim to create a structured approach to knowledge transfer, facilitating the handling complex conversion tasks and empowering our team with the confidence and competence needed.  <br>Also, it's worth mentioning that our KT process is designed to be flexible and responsive to the team's evolving needs. As our collective experience and proficiency grow, we anticipate that the demand and duration of the daily stand-up meetings may not be needed or shortened. We'll continually assess the progress and adjust accordingly, ensuring our approach remains efficient and aligned with the team's capabilities. Continued feedback will be instrumental in this ongoing refinement, keeping us agile and focused on our shared goals.  <br><br>ACC User Experience Team&nbsp;<br>American College of Cardiology<br>2400 N Street NW<br>Washington DC, 20037<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="render:///www.acc.org" rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="render://www.acc.org" target="_blank">www.acc.org</a>]]></description><link>work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/kt-sessions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Editorial training/KT SESSIONS.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[experience editor]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>Considering the difficulties that editors encounter in distinguishing between legacy, converted, and legacy supportive components, owing to the absence of folder structure and clear naming, we've introduced a streamlined approach. All component icons are now set to grey or red by default. However, converted and supportive components, along with the majority of new work, will be marked with either blue icons for compatible renderings or green for new arches components. This blue color is intended to be the default setting both arches and legacy supportive components. It's essential for the development team to review and ensure this default setting when releasing new work into the platform. In any instance where the blue green or grey is not the icon for the rending, the setting must be promptly corrected.<br>
Further Icon Definition allow for even easier recognition in the back end will be. Page Layout components should be Starts, Vue/JavaScript driven components should be puzzle pieces.  <br><br>When looking at the display view list in the backend you only see the render name and its relative location that it is placed in the list. As the teams move forward in using more and more shared content and breaking down content into chunks the Display view gets rather unuable becuase you would see RichText written possilbly 5 times on the page the same is true with accordions. In that view is it possible to interject at least the details of the source which can be altered with a nickname like intro-text, benifit grid.....<br><br>The component dependency tree outlines the interrelationships between components in a Sitecore instance, specifically identifying those that are either children of a component or have dependent child components. Only necessary components should be configured in this instance to maintain simplicity and reduce confusion for editors. This approach also minimizes the risk of including non-supportive components by lessening the need for editors to manually add components. Ultimately, this method aids in preventing the appearance of non-supportive components within converted pages, ensuring a clean and efficient working environment.]]></description><link>work/acc/arches/conversion/components/quality-of-life-configurations-with-sitecore.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Components/Quality of life configurations with Sitecore.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 22:05:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating A New ACC.org Component]]></title><description><![CDATA[

There are not resubscribe flows because not built in 1crm.<br>
The rub is that the subscriptions types show up on the renew page.<br>
1CRM opt-ins do not matching the opt-ins from higher logic. Suggest going into the delta from 1crm and higher logic.
