 <br><br><br>The file includes all the necessary assets to create guideline algorithms, ensuring consistency across all designs. To maintain the established design system, use the provided color swatches, Illustrator panels, and graphic, character, and paragraph styles.<br>These design enforcements support a consistent experience and are reader-focused, making the algorithms easy to read, understand, and provide valuable information like the CORs (Class of Recommendation). The algorithm is mostly monochromatic, with a focus on high contrast separation between the background and text to improve readability. COR colors are used specifically to highlight important information, ensuring that critical details stand out for the reader.<br><br>
<br>Node and Decision Symbols: Always use the predefined symbols for nodes and decisions. These symbols are already designed to align with the correct COR color and shape, ensuring that each element is visually consistent and recognizable.<br>

<br>Line and Label Symbols: Use the predefined line and label symbols to maintain consistent visual direction and clarity. Lines such as "YES," "NO," and the avoid markers are standardized for effective communication.<br>

<br>Node Binders: Use symbols like NODE BINDER -- AND, NODE BINDER -- OR, and NODE BINDER -- ANY to represent logical connections between nodes clearly. This ensures that all decision junctions are presented in a consistent manner.<br>

<br>Line Styles: Lines connecting nodes are styled consistently with arrows indicating the direction of flow. There are no variations in line thickness.<br>

<br>Text Alignment: Text within each node should be aligned to the left and vertically centered to enhance readability.<br>

<br>Legend Placement: Place the legend in the top right corner by default. If there is insufficient space, use the bottom right, followed by the bottom left. Legends should never be placed in the top left.<br>

<br>Refer to the finished example to understand how these elements work together to create a consistent and branded algorithm design.<br><br>The Illustrator file is set up with an artboard named "Toolkit," which contains all the essential elements for designing guideline algorithms. This toolkit includes:<br>
<br>Symbols: Predefined symbols such as data nodes, decision shapes, and other graphic elements.<br>

<br>Graphic Styles: Graphic Styles are used for line styles and arrows, applying the consistent look and feel to lines and arrows based on a simple line in Illustrator.<br>

<br>Character Styles: The character styles in the file include options for titles, labels, node content, and more. Use the Title style for main headings, Zone Label for section labels, and Node Regular or Node Strong for content within nodes. There are also specific styles for COR Labels to ensure that Class of Recommendation values stand out appropriately.<br>

<br>Paragraph Styles: Utilize the Paragraph Styles to maintain consistency across body text and labels. For instance, use Node Text for text within nodes and Footnotes for any additional information provided at the bottom of the algorithm. The Line Labels style ensures all directional labels (e.g., "YES," "NO") are clearly formatted.<br>

<br>Color Swatches: The approved color palette for decision points and node types.<br>

<br>Toolkit Artboard: Refer to the toolkit artboard to quickly access and apply these elements.<br>

<br><br>
<br>Use the Toolkit: Start by using the elements provided in the toolkit artboard to maintain consistency.<br>

<br>Smart Alignment: Use smart guides to align elements properly, ensuring nodes align in the same column for a clean and professional layout.<br>

<br>Apply Character and Paragraph Styles: Always use the predefined character and paragraph styles to ensure that text formatting is consistent. This includes titles, labels, footnotes, and node content. Consistent use of styles helps maintain a reader-friendly experience and aligns with branding standards.

 <br>Presentation of <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="Work/ACC/Projects/Member Sections" data-href="Work/ACC/Projects/Member Sections" href="\work\acc\projects\member-sections.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener nofollow">Member Sections</a><br>The future design of Member Sections operates on a simple tenant: showcase value while giving the user actionable steps to access that value. <br>The design decisions to follow are to build the foundation of the experience.<br>Member sections are an exclusive space tailored to capture resources, tools, and opportunities to engage in mentoring and/or gain pathways to leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp; ​<br>​<br>To support this, we established a new dynamic and personalized onboarding process to meet users where they are rather than giving them instructions that cover what could be a multiple-week ordeal to gain access. At every step, we want to showcase to users what they are missing out on. We intend to reward the users by opening up specialized areas in Docmatter and curating exclusive content behind the access walls.<br><br>Let's dive into some of the details. When talking about onboarding, we want to consider 4 user states: ​<br>
<br>LOGGED OUT
<br>NOT A MEMBER OF THE COLLEGE
<br>A MEMBER WHO DOESN'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SECTION
<br>A USER WITH FULL ACCESS.​
<br>​<br>These personalization hooks give us the flexibility to craft the experience, allowing for better instructions and selling tactics.<br>Only users of a specific state are shown the&nbsp;next steps in their personalized journey. ​ This allows us to craft the upsell and instructions to Membership for example or the Member Section when the time is appropriate.<br><br>Now that the onboarding process has become simplified in messaging and action, we can discuss how our users are often part of more than one section. To reduce mental friction when moving from one section to another, we want to strongly enforce consistency.​  This consistency can been seen in the design pattern, the layouts and more importantly the labels and page structures. <br>​<br>
This will allow our multifaceted members to experience an organized environment so they can focus on the content rather than where it was labeled or placed. An added benefit is that when new features are rolled out, they are easier to discover.​<br><br>Personalization will not be added to just the main page. The content zones of sections will also showcase content at different levels keyed to the user's access. This can showcase the quality of materials and enforce a desire to gain full access to this quality content.]]></description><link>work\acc\projects\acc-redesign\member-sections-presentation-script.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/ACC Redesign/Member Sections Presentation Script.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 11 Dec 2024 16:03:36 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2024 Week 50]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Intro
<br>How We Investigated the Problem

<br>Website Audits at Multiple Focused Levels: Content, Member Section Deep Dive, and UX Analysis

<br>Multi layered investigations have been done against this section of content




<br>Cutting the Fat &amp; Taking out the Trash

<br>Website Content Audit We have discovered obsolete pages and reduces the content and value that we need to cater to.

<br>Enforcing a new pattern for content production to reduce the repeat of this issue in the future. Doc Matter will take on some of content that once lived here. 
<br>The  content that is left in this zone will be more aggressively archived to reduce regaining bloat. 




<br>Dealing with the Customer Experience

<br>The Member Section Deep Dive has found the inconsistency has lead to a confused customer experience. Has lead to maintenance problems which as drained resources over the years stopping us from improving this facet of the Member Benefits to its fullest. Optimizing and simplifying can open up time and effort to really drive content and facilitation to return value back to the members.

<br>Structure Becomes the Same
<br>Content Channels become easier to follow
<br>Cross Usage and onboarding becomes simplified in messaging and action




<br>Reinforcing Value to Member Sections

<br>Member Section as a value exclusive access to tailored resources, mentorship, and leadership opportunities within specialized communities, helping professionals advance their careers, build credibility, and stay connected to the latest developments in their field.

<br>Access to Exclusive Content comes with putting the content behind a need to login. 

<br>This can open up future opportunities to enrich this content from conversations started in Doc Matter and through Workgroup Polish made into valuable resources and toolkits specific to these member sections


<br>Specialized Gated Digital Communities of Doc Matter established areas to start mentorship, and leadership opportunities
<br>Linking Globally Published Content builds Nontreaty and Visibility of the Section




<br>How does this work in the real world -

<br>Prototype Example.

 <br><br>This is an audit of the two Product Pages that currently have overlapping content. Below is a numbered list of the two pages, and how they will be referred to thereafter:<br>
<br>Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S.:<br>
a. Referred to as CVTeam.
<br>Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S.:<br>
a. Referred to as Clinician-OUS.
<br>The two pages—"CVTEAM" and "Clinician-OUS"—contain significant overlap and some type-specific content. The recommendations below aim to streamline and unify both pages for clarity and ease of navigation for users. Content can be categorized into three groups: identical, very similar, and type-specific. The goal is to consolidate identical content, modify the similar content to fit both groups where applicable, and keep type-specific information targeted to the specific audience.<br><br>
<br>
Unify Duplicate Sections: Many sections across both pages have the same or nearly identical content, such as "How Will the Exam be Administered?", "What is the Reliability of This Exam?", and "What Topics Are Included on This Exam?". Consolidate these into one central resource (such as a FAQ) that is shared between both audiences.

<br>
Keep Persona-Specific Details Separate: Type-specific content should be kept separate where necessary to ensure that information remains relevant and directly applicable to each audience, e.g., "Who's Eligible to Take ACC's Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE)?" where eligibility criteria differ for NPs/PAs versus physicians.

<br>
Create Cross-References to Simplify Navigation: Provide hyperlinks between shared sections and persona-specific pages to make it easier for users to navigate between general and specific content. This will improve the overall user journey by reducing the likelihood of confusion between similar content.

<br><br><br><br><img alt="Pasted image 20241030170446.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20241030170446.png"><br>The proposed AI structure helps streamline the content by focusing each page's role to enhance user experience, reduce redundancy, and provide clear navigation pathways even when users arrive at the wrong page variant.<br>
<br>Product Page: Centralizes key exam-related content, making it the first point of reference for all users. It focuses on eligibility, application processes, exam administration, and a general overview, ensuring consistency and reducing noise by keeping shared content unified.
<br>Persona Detail Pages: Targeted at specific roles, these pages provide tailored details for eligibility, exam dates, preparation resources, and other specifics. By keeping type-specific information on dedicated pages, users can easily navigate to content relevant to their background without sifting through unrelated details.
<br>FAQ Page: Acts as a shared resource for questions that apply to both personas. This page will address common concerns, minimizing redundancy and providing a quick, centralized place for users to find general information. Hyperlinks will be used to direct users to persona-specific details where necessary.
<br>This structure is designed to help users who might have arrived at the wrong variant by guiding them to the right section, thus reducing user frustration and improving satisfaction.<br><br>Consolidation of Identical and Very Similar Content: Move sections that are largely duplicated to a shared FAQ or product page. These sections include "How Will the Exam be Administered?", "What is the Reliability of This Exam?", and "Does the CCKE Offer a Credential?" Doing so will help reduce maintenance efforts while also improving consistency for users.<br>
<br>
Maintaining Persona-Specific Content: For sections that are specific to either "Clinician-OUS" or "CVTeam," create separate Persona Detail Pages. For instance, eligibility requirements, submission details, and exam dates vary between the two audiences. Keeping these sections separate but cross-referencing shared content will reduce confusion while allowing both pages to provide specialized information.

<br>
Use of Accordion Components: Keep the collapsible accordion structure to allow users to access content in manageable portions, making the pages less overwhelming. Ensure that each accordion component has consistent headings and styles across both "CVTeam" and "Clinician-OUS" pages.

<br>
Navigation Enhancements: To further reduce confusion, provide clear links at the end of shared sections like "How Much Does This Exam Cost?" to direct users to persona-specific details.

<br><br>If the two products cannot be merged, it is recommended to rebrand one or both products to ensure they are distinguishable and reduce confusion. The proposed rebranding involves the following:<br>
<br>
Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for NPs/PAs Practicing in the U.S. (CVTeam): 

<br>Maintain existing branding, but emphasize that this version of the exam is specifically for U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants.


<br>
Certified Cardiovascular Knowledge Examination (CCKE) for Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S. (Clinician-OUS):

<br>Rebrand this product to differentiate it more clearly from CVTeam. Consider adding a geographic or professional distinction to the name, such as "International Cardiovascular Knowledge Certification" or "Certified Cardiovascular Competence for International Physicians".


<br>
Visual and Structural Distinction:

<br>Introduce distinct color schemes or visual markers on both product pages to signal the difference at a glance.
<br>Update headers and footers to clearly mention the audience for each product, e.g., "For Physicians Practicing Outside the U.S." vs. "For U.S.-based Nurse Practitioners and Physician Assistants".


<br>
Clarify Naming Across All Communications:

<br>Update all marketing, email, and support documentation to ensure that users are consistently seeing the rebranded names.
<br>Ensure that cross-references between the products are explicit about the intended audience to avoid any ambiguity.


<br>The goal of the rebranding effort is to reduce confusion, particularly among members who may be unsure which certification is appropriate for their professional background. By creating a stronger distinction between the two certifications, ACC can improve user satisfaction and reduce the potential for misapplication.]]></description><link>work\acc\projects\ccke\ccke-content-proposal.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Projects/CCKE/CCKE Content Proposal.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2024 22:29:17 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\pasted-image-20241030170446.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib\media\pasted-image-20241030170446.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[No Content Change Proposal]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Before I start this, I want to ask you to "love this for 5 minutes," then you can react.<br>In the act of working with clients, we often take the content documents we are offered, and our reaction to doing IA is to take that content and shoehorn it into UI to satisfy the client.<br><br>For years and possibly decades, I have taken content documents and shaved off a word or two. However, I have come to realize the immense detriment I have been doing to the strategic approach to content creation by skipping to the UI answer. Instead of merely using 'Styled UI' to reshape, mutate, and hide content, we should focus on enhancing the content to bolster the user experience by solving the underlying issues that users might face with the content that was initially delivered.<br><br>I have a different opinion on why we shouldn't create wireframes this early in a project. For the sake of speed, we, myself included, often skip the IA step, rushing to return to the client with wireframes. We then cleverly force their content into blocks and hidden areas on the page. The downside of internalizing the IA within the team and applying layouts and UI to content is that it directs our conversations with business lines toward solutions, rather than focusing on improving the content on the site. This undermines the value that IA discussions can bring. Jumping straight to UI wires limits our ability to challenge how we receive and refine raw content. We should at least help them transform it before we start applying UI.<br>I want to ensure there is a moment when clients are encouraged and guided to evaluate the provided content. Content strategists can have the greatest impact by unlocking the potential for more effective and engaging content.<br><br>Here is an example of what happens when we skip straight to UI. The wireframes react to the content as it is provided. In the team's review of overwhelming content, we responded by using accordions in the UI to hide excess information. This was a superficial fix that masked the issue—that the content was too lengthy and not concise. No changes were made to the content itself because we had already hidden it.<br>Now we have introduced a situation where our users are forced into a discovery mode, and we haven't solved the problem that the content was too much or not aligned with the actual goals of the page.<br><br>To maximize the effectiveness of content, we need to change our approach. Instead of rushing into UI design, we should follow a structured process:<br>
<br>Content Evaluation: Review the content before doing any design work. Understand the purpose of the content and whether it aligns with the project's goals.
<br>Information Architecture (IA) Application: Use IA to refine, organize, and simplify the content into a logical structure. Ensure that the content is easily navigable and user-friendly.
<br>Content Transformation: Apply appropriate hierarchies and organize the text logically. If necessary, split the content across multiple pages to make it more digestible.

<br>This should be a word document
<br>You can outline that content is either series on the page or is in parallel.
<br>Should denote page breaks and how it is wired between pages.


<br>Content Presentation: Share the revised content with the client. Encourage them to review it in a Word document format so they can engage with the material and provide feedback.
<br>Content Refinement: Based on client feedback, refine the content further. Make sure it is concise, clear, and aligned with the project’s objectives.
<br>UI Design: Only after finalizing the content should we begin designing the UI. At this stage, the content will be well-organized, aligned with user goals, and ready to be integrated into the page layout.
<br>By following these steps, we ensure that the content drives the design, not the other way around. This structured approach leads to better user experiences and more effective communication.<br>
<br>Where does this go?
<br>Should this be another page?
<br>What is this content saying?
<br>Should we hide this from the user?
<br>What is the point of this page?
<br>What are the goals, and does this content support them?
<br>Let’s encourage our clients to review the content in a Word document. It’s important for them to read through the information and share their thoughts. This step is crucial to ensure that the content matches the project’s goals and is easy for users to understand. As content strategists, we should lead this conversation by presenting our findings and showing our dedication to delivering top-quality content.<br>Only when we have finalized the content can we move on to page designs and work on the UI.]]></description><link>work/acc/thoughts/not-using-ui-but-word-documents.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Thoughts/Not Using UI but Word Documents.md</guid><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2024 15:18:02 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Maximize Conversions with Integrated Marketing]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Email Marketing<br>Here’s a streamlined process flow for utilizing Direct Marketing Emails, Social Posts, and Web Marketing to drive users to landing pages with single goal CTAs, optimizing for conversion:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240924173228.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png"><br><br>
<br>Objective: Whether the goal is membership sign-up, promoting a specific product, or encouraging course enrollment, start with a clear and single-focused goal.<br>

<br>Audience Segmentation: Use member data to segment your audience (e.g., new vs. existing members, product preferences, or education needs). Tailor your messaging accordingly.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173258.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173258.png"><br><br>
<br>Personalized Messaging: Send segmented, targeted emails based on member interest or product interaction. Use personalized subject lines and content to engage the recipient.<br>

<br>Single CTA Focus: Keep the email concise, focusing on one action—whether it's signing up for membership, taking a course, or learning more about a product.<br>

<br>Visual Hierarchy: Design with a clear CTA button or link, driving to a landing page. Limit distractions or additional links.

<br>Example: “Unlock exclusive member benefits” with a CTA leading to a landing page with a “Join Now” button.<br>



<br>Follow-up Emails: If no action is taken, send follow-up reminders, highlighting urgency or limited-time offers.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173344.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173344.png"><br><br>
<br>Awareness &amp; Engagement: Post engaging, relevant content that raises awareness about the specific service or product. Use visuals (images, videos) that catch attention quickly.<br>

<br>Clear CTA in Posts: Always include a direct link to the landing page with a single action goal, such as “Learn More”, “Join Today”, or “Enroll Now”.<br>

<br>Varied Post Types: Rotate between promotional posts (e.g., “Limited time offer on our educational courses”) and value-based posts (e.g., testimonials, expert tips) to maintain engagement.<br>

<br>Boosted Posts &amp; Ads: Use paid promotions on social platforms to target users based on demographics or past interaction, driving them to the dedicated landing page.<br>

<br>Engagement-driven CTAs: Use CTAs like “Get Started” or “Explore More” to reduce friction in the initial click.
  <img alt="Pasted image 20240924173411.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173411.png">
<br><br>
<br>Banner Ads &amp; Pop-ups: Design targeted ads that appear on key sections of your website. Ensure that these ads promote the single focused CTA (e.g., membership sign-up or course enrollment).<br>

<br><br>
<br>Single Goal CTA: Each landing page should have one clear CTA, whether it's "Join Now", "Sign Up", or "Purchase". Avoid clutter and additional links that could distract users from the primary goal.<br>

<br>Consistent Messaging: Ensure the landing page reflects the content of the email, social post, or web ad that drove traffic to it, creating a seamless and relevant user experience.<br>

<br>Urgency &amp; Value Proposition: Use language that emphasizes urgency (e.g., “Limited time offer”) and the value proposition (e.g., “Exclusive benefits for members”).<br>

<br>Mobile Optimization: Make sure landing pages are mobile-friendly for users arriving via mobile social posts or email.<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173440.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173440.png"><br><br>
<br>Track Conversions: Use tools like Google Analytics, UTM codes, or your CRM to monitor which channels (emails, social posts, or web ads) are driving the most traffic and conversions.<br>

<br>Abandoned Landing Page Follow-Up: If users visit the landing page but don’t convert, trigger automated reminder emails or retargeting ads to bring them back, offering added incentives or urgency.<br>

<br>Next Steps for Conversions: Once a user converts, deliver a thank you email or confirmation page, guiding them to the next step in their member journey (e.g., onboarding for members, product usage tips).<br>

<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173458.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173458.png"><br><br>
<br>
Direct Email:

<br>Send an email to non-members emphasizing the value of membership (e.g., “Unlock exclusive access to resources, discounts, and courses”).<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to membership sign-up landing page.<br>



<br>
Social Media Post:

<br>Post a testimonial or success story from a current member, emphasizing the benefits.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Learn More” → Redirect to landing page that further explains membership benefits.<br>



<br>
Website Banner Ad:

<br>Place a banner on relevant blog or content pages: “Become a Member Today and Get Access to Premium Courses”.<br>

<br>Clear CTA: “Join Now” → Redirect to landing page optimized for membership sign-ups.<br>



<br>By focusing on single-action CTAs, and maintaining consistent, clear messaging across all communication channels, this process maximizes the chances of conversion from email, social, and web marketing efforts.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240924173524.png" src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173524.png">]]></description><link>work/acc/thoughts/maximize-conversions-with-integrated-marketing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Thoughts/Maximize Conversions with Integrated Marketing.md</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 23:54:44 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src="lib/media/pasted-image-20240924173228.png"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Structure & Guidance]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><a data-href="Page Creation Guidance" href="work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/page-creation-guidance.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Page Creation Guidance</a><br>Focus the User- Always write to the goal of the page or task of the initiative.  In the first sentence or area of the page the user should easily tell the action they should take.  And every piece of content should support, educate, or compel the user to act upon the task of the page. <br>Reduce - Reductive writing is best online users shy away from long blurbs of text.<br>
Reuse - Don't repeat similar or same blocks of text or content. If there are reasons for content to be used in multiple areas - link to it, or pattern it as a resource that users an engage with if they need it.<br>
Recycle- The title of the page you are linking to is usually not enough to be engaging. <br>
<br>Put the link within the text of the page,
<br>rewrite the hook to get users to the page by lifting up concepts and reasons for the user to engage with the link to navigate to it.
<br>Breaking a part the titles and content  so it is easier to scan. For Example Name of the doctor, concept of content, and type of content distinguished by style allows users to faster then it all written out as single line.

 <br><br>
<br><a data-href="SPA Intake" href="work/acc/jira/spa-intake.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">SPA Intake</a> Ticket kicks all of this off
<br>Design and Requirements
<br>Technical Feasibility
<br>Design Iteration Follow Up from Technical Feasibility
<br>Basic Application: Data &amp; API
<br>Basic Application: Page Construction, Code Branch, Page Access
<br>Basic Application: Vue APP SHELL
<br>Basic Application: Application Initiation.
<br>Component Construction: 1 – Many Tickets
<br>Application Specifics | Feature X scaffolding: 1 – Many Tickets
<br>Application Integration with Components | Feature X Refinement with QA: 1 – Many Tickets
<br><br><br>These types of tickets come in phases where many of the branches can work in partnership moving the designed application forward with some autonomy.<br><br>These tickets are iterative and often are labeled the “Sprint 0” depending on the ask from the product owner and how developed the concept is before the team receives the project this will be iterative. Often this should be a set of meetings and reviews between the UX Team and Technical Architect and Front-End Senior Lead with responses sent back to the UX team and ultimately the Product Owner. Depending on how “Lean” you want to run the project this can be as lean as a rough sketch where the particulars are hashed out in the project to full-blown comps with requirement notes being captured in the Parent “Epic” Ticket. Initial talks of analytics should be talked about prompt the BL to reach out to the analytics team to establish this branch of the requirements.<br><br>When the receiving team is comfortable with the clarity of the intended product this phase will break down the ask into dispersible tickets. Depending on the skill and resources these tickets can be sized appropriately for the team. Basic Application Construction can start on day one considering the scaffolding is fundamental to any other work.<br><br>Independent work is brought together in this phase. It is common that co-working and JAD sessions occur in these tickets as team members bring together the individual efforts. There is no clean break of this phase to previous depending on the delivery it is common that a feature might go through all phases and be QA’d before other features are even started.<br><br><br>Design Phase is the most prone to change. This phase should be mostly completed before the rest of the tasks should start. There is always reason, technical or just iterating over an experience that can cause changes to the design but if the team has a good idea of what is being built and rework will be reduced. The tenants of AGILE does allow for iteration so it is inevitable that rework or alteration will happen. Documenting for the team should migrate to comments on design documents because living design documents are costly and in the end are a non-production artifact. It is very important that the Technology Team (DEV &amp; UI Lead) break down the steps and familiarize themselves with the nuances of the features to intelligently question the design and highlight possible issues before alterations become more impactful to the timelines. QA at this point can even scaffold out User Tests on features during this step.<br><br><br>Team review of the UX design of Project X. Highlight and Flag and Feasibility Changes and Iterate over them with the UX team. Team will submit a scaffolding of tickets to produce the Application. Details should include Data needs, Implementation Specifics, Analytics definitions, and Front-End Breakdown.<br><br><br>These steps are mostly dependent on the previous and could be collapsed to a single ticket but the ambiguity of the Data API it is best to keep these tickets into separate tickets to utilize a wider base of resources.<br><br><br>API &amp; Data Structures to support the application outline the data handshake and return results for App Build Team &amp; UI Team.<br><br>A user may only visit the URL if the user is logged in. The page will do all needed steps to redirect the user through log in in needed and redirect the user back to the page after success. Define URL &amp; create the hosting page in Sitecore.<br><br>A user should be able to visit a URL and have an application on that page respond to the visitor with the information it has available to it. Create the shell of the application and establish needed hooks to the data the application will know. This information is defined by the project but in the most basic definitions the application will know about the User, and possibly the URL and any query structures.<br><br>When the user visits the application, and it is loaded the application will initiate and collect information through API calls to store any data that is needed to display information and formulate any actions needed for the user defined by the project.<br><br><br>Components should follow the single tenant that they are only responsible for data passed to them and emitting their context. This separates concerns when the Application takes most of the features and components can stay agnostic.<br>When creating components all new components will be created with the library’s project folder. If the team finds value for a specific component that is generic enough to be reusable across many applications, the component can be promoted to a common library folder. Be aware that common components require a greater level of flexibility and scope to make them bullet proof for generic consumption.<br><br><br>Component tickets should encompass basic mutations that are needed for that component. Basic examples or mutations are Size, Location or Inclusion, Props (Data they will display), Validations, States, Etc. This should result in a Code Review and a Demo with UX Team and Product Owner. To reduce meeting overload, they can be grouped with other tickets or be deferred to the Feature Refinement Ticket<br><br><br>The user should be able to see the data they need to see and interact with data as defined by the requirements this is known as feature. In many cases features can be scaffolded with their data and methods without the need of utilizing components. Operations of an application like looping, reductions, additions, removals, data hooks and server responses can be all worked out without the use of components.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature. <br>For Example, “scaffold delete this line item from the list.” This will produce a data storage, list and methods and listeners that can be used to remove data from the list. This would also include any database API and deal with the response return updating the stored data of the list.<br><br><br>Inclusion of components and refinement of the frontend features. These phases will “wire” data and properties to components into the application. Depending on the size of the application these can be broken down into Features, or Pages, or States. This is the moment where components are due from the front-end teams. The deployment of components can be more staggered if the team is more comfortable with constant deployments. The benefits of this would be a lister would be available much earlier in the development process but may need to be updated or rewired if changes to validation or data needs alter in the refinement process.<br><br><br>User should be able to do X Feature in the App<br>For Example, “A user by clicking on the delete button on a list item should delete it from the list.” Render a data list with the delete button. On the click add a listener to the application that will trigger the delete feature that has been scaffolded. QA this feature. Demo this Feature with UX Team and Product Owner.]]></description><link>work/acc/structure-and-content-guidance/spa/outline-of-tickets-for-spas-in-vue.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Structure and Content Guidance/SPA/Outline of Tickets for SPAs in Vue.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Page Content]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Gray, ME, 04039<br>Dear Ms. Morris,<br>
I hope this letter finds you well. I have enclosed the two original notarized documents previously sent to you via email, which authorize me to act on my mother's behalf. However, as I am relatively unfamiliar with the specifics of functioning as a Power of Attorney in this capacity, I am reaching out for your guidance on the next steps that must be taken to facilitate my active management of her accounts, particularly regarding the issuance of checks.<br>
I want to inquire about the process of using checks on behalf of my mother for her bill payments and other financial necessities. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the following:<br>
⦁	Do I need to order checks that include my name, indicating my authority to manage her financial transactions?<br>
⦁	Do I need to sign checks in a particular way to ensure they are processed without issue? This may include any necessary notations that might be required to denote my POA status.<br>
Your advice and assistance in clarifying these matters are crucial to me. They would greatly help me fulfill my obligations as my mother's POA with confidence and efficiency.<br>
Furthermore, if any additional steps or documentation are required from my side to fully activate my POA privileges for managing my mother's account, especially concerning online banking and bill payments, please inform me at your earliest convenience.<br>
Thank you very much for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your guidance and am eager to ensure that all necessary arrangements are in place to manage my mother's financial affairs seamlessly. Please feel free to contact me at 301-768-0495 or via email at <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="mailto:mattwatier@gmail.com" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="mailto:mattwatier@gmail.com" target="_blank">mattwatier@gmail.com</a> if you need any further information or documentation from me.<br>

<br>Tip: Add humorous or lighthearted content to ease frustration.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Display a clear message explaining the request was incorrect or malformed. Suggest actions the user can take, such as reloading the page or checking for errors in the URL.
<br>Tip: Guide users to report the issue if it persists.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Redirect users to a login page with a clear explanation that access requires authentication. Offer a link to reset passwords if needed.
<br>Tip: Keep the login process simple and user-friendly, avoiding unnecessary steps.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Inform the user that they don’t have permission to access the requested page, and suggest contacting support if they believe this is an error.
<br>Tip: If the user is logged out, consider prompting them to log in, if applicable.
<br><br><br>
<br>Solution: Display a friendly error message stating that something went wrong on the server. Provide a link to the homepage or suggest the user try again later.
<br>Tip: Include an option to report the issue directly to the support team.

 <br>Before the generators shut off for the night, I frantically jot down notes about the day next to my wife as she does the same.<br>The first day of our hike was primarily about transferring from trains and planes to automobiles. More accurately, it involved taking a bus to a boat and a short stroll to the first lodge, the Glade House. Nestled in a field close to a stream, the lodge appears dreamlike and safe, surrounded by woods and towering mountain faces. The views past the treeline foreshadowed our upcoming days of adventure. At this point, Milford Trek is lush, verdant, and beautiful, yet teeming with pesky black flies.<br>Ultimate Hike runs a tight ship. The four guides are putting in great effort herding cats, acting as social cheerleaders, and handling every other task needed for this roaming, all-inclusive hotel.<br>We are not alone on this trek; in reality, we are a crowd in the middle of nowhere. There are 48 of us attempting to complete this trek, and we all have high spirits, blessed with ideal weather and having covered basically no miles thus far. The crowd includes a significant number of Japanese, Korean, and, oddly enough, Midwestern participants, sprinkled with some interesting characters. There is a family from Indiana: Troy, Maria, and their daughter Maya; they have a son who, for some reason didn't want to go to New Zealand. Then, there is lesbian married couple from Oakland, California. They are a fun and unique pair – one is a professor of automotive repair, and the other is an ex-Army vet with a history of working in remote places doing humanitarian relief. Then there's a lone traveler, Eric, an older Scottish gentleman who seems entirely at ease wandering away from his cold homeland during the winter months all by himself.<br>This trip promises to be enjoyable with this new group of strangers who will soon become friends through our shared traverse.]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/day-1-getting-there.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Day 1 - getting there.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Day 2 - Into the Woods]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>Early morning starts at the first lodge. Strangers shuffle into the common area as rain falls outside. Tables fill, and the gap of strangers begins to wane as we chat and learn about each other. Buffets of sandwich fixings scatter two tables, and we all take turns hobbling together our lunches with combos of vegetables, including beetroot, carrot, and cucumber slices with meat cheeses and mayo-based salads. We thought wraps would travel best, but we were wrong a few hours later as we washed our hands in a stream to get our hands clean.&nbsp;<br>Still drizzling, we started in mass to our day of travel. Raincoats, rain pants, and backpack slicks on almost certainly scared away the rain because as we started, the rain fizzled out with a glimmer of sun breaking off into the distance. Across the first bridge, less than a kilometer, we are officially on our way, hiking the Milford track, and the sun greets us officially for the day.&nbsp; <br>Our guides gave us a tiny navigational bit of advice: if the river we just crossed over is ever on our left, we are making our day longer, and we need to turn around. With the Clinton River now our navigational guide for the day, we headed out. The trail is softly rolling with no real incline gain. The flat trails flirt with the river, diving in and out of the woods all morning. Everyone feeling strong, we stayed together in a loose line, with the fastest of us stretching way, and the mass started to thin, so only a few hikers were in view at a time.&nbsp;<br>The mile markers quickly became a game as we took selfies with all we could find. The first extra trail along our path came into view as we saw a pile of backpacks, so the guides knew we didn't leave someone behind. We headed toward what I kept called the watershed, but it was a two-minute walk to the wetlands. From the end, it was a circle of wooden paths that broke out of the trees into bushes of blooming Manuka.&nbsp;  <br>Lush green leaves and newly sprouted Brown fiddle heads spring from bouquets of ferns on both sides of the track. Rocky beaches broke out on the right, edged by the Emerald-tinted Clinton River.&nbsp;<br>At mile 6, we say goodbye to the Clinton River, and the track gains more sweeping inclines. By mile 8, we have caught up with our guides and fellow hikers tucking into their sandwiches. At the hut, our guides hand out liquid beverages in mugs: coffee, tea, Milo hot chocolate, and raro, a Gatorade-like powder that, when mixed into the water, makes a tang like orange sugar water.&nbsp;<br>After a rest and bathroom break in some of the nicest maintained outhouses I have ever been in because there was supplied TP, we were back on the trail for our final three miles.&nbsp;<br>Shortly after restarting the trail, we departed the shelter of the trees, and we entered a spectacular hallway of mountain cliffs gilded with silver-threaded waterfalls.&nbsp;<br>Small lakes fed by the falling water scattered over the next few miles. Parts of the trail have 4-foot tall makers with arrows pointing to another post only six feet away. Luckily, a guide passed by and explained that this entire zone of the hike could be submerged by flood waters when it rains hard, and earlier that year, he had passed through with water up to his thigh. Grateful for skipping that variation of the hike, we all thanked the Blues skies and the sun even though it was slowly baking us. A mile from the lodge was our last Lake, where we were encouraged to cool off and dip. Vivian, soaking her feet in the ice water, was happy to record my experience of getting into the water. Cold and clear water after the shock wore off was an excellent salve for sore shoulders and tired feet.&nbsp;<br>After drying off, we headed onto the last leg of the day. The end mile ruined what would have been a long but easy walk because we were barred from the end by an avalanche fall. Deep steps and bolder scrambles quickly added another layer of sweetness and a few curses. Thirty minutes later, we found ourselves at the gates of Pamelo Lodge.&nbsp;<br>After showers and stretches and putting clean lodge clothes on, we joined our fellow trekking family for drinks and stunning views of the mountains. I was too lazy and tired to go back to my room to retrieve my bug repellent, so I continuously killed the sandflies that were trying to extract a liter of blood. This was the greatest mistake of the hike because I discovered days later that the inoculous bites turned maddeningly itchy spots 2 days later.&nbsp;<br>Good conversations sprung up around our table as they served a three-course meal and ended with a Creme Brulee<br>A small briefing of the day ahead and the days expenditure drove most of us back to our rooms, and we all probably fell asleep before the generators turned off at 10 PM.]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/day-2-into-the-woods.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Day 2 - Into the Woods.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Day 3 - Alpine Crossing]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Day 3 - Milford Track: Alpine Crossing<br>The days have now fallen into a routine.   Get up stretch to push away the stiffness.  Pack out lunch in the center lodge and grab breakfast.  Head back to our rooms fold everything back into our backpacks and crush our feet back into our hiking boots.   20ish pounds on our back we are out in the trail.   <br>Cloud cover is thick this morning and we have no expectations of rain so we all head out in mass but because of the incline the divides between people quickly expand till my wife and I are walking with out signs of other hikers.  <br>A good hour in still in the woods we have gained some elevation but we know the worst of it is too come.  We drop our pack at the next huts and toilets and are greatest buy glimpses of kea an alpine parrot.   The birds are talkative and very loud.<br>Back on the trail we start the Alpine crossing.   11 original switch backs that are roughly a 1/3 km long and because of a rock slide a bonus 4 a, b, c &amp;d of steep short switch backs.   Climbing 600m wefeel like we are in Jurassic Park as the parrots continue to sqwak and chatter in the fog-draped trees and moss.  <br>When we get past halfway through the switchbacks We have reached the Alpine division and shadowy glimpse of the parrots haunt us obscured by the the ever thickening clouds.   We leave behind the trees giving way to large leafy plants wildflowers and spikey grass.  Looking up we can see colorful blurs within the mist of our fellow hikers as we grow close on mountain side as the switch backs cross above and below each other.   <br>The trail finally does fold back on itself and we are on the ridge.   Cloud strong winds great us as we continue to climate and drop on the grass topped Mckinnon pass.  A monument to the adventure that mapped this route up over the pass.  cooling sweat forces us to dawn warmer cloths.  Fleece, gloves and hats help us hold onto some warmth as we wander through low visibility fog.  At this point I wonder if lugging my 4 lb camera in this trail will even be worth it.   <br>We quickly come pass a sign that I assume was supposed to fill us with hope that it is 30 minutes to the shelter where we are taking a lunch break.   But thirty minutes on spent legs, no visibility, and a rocky incline depress us as it is too far away to be a comfort.  Multiple cursing sessions later and more then 30 minutes we find ourselves enter the shelter which to me feels like a sauna.   <br>Quickly stripping away the packs and layers we find likely in the back of the pack as some are already gearing back up and heading out.   I tell my wife we need to pause here for 30-45 minutes because all the incline we just took will be decline as soon as we leave the shelter and we should let ourselves take in some calories and rest.   <br>At the Alpine crossing after lunch we fill our water packs and get ready to head back out not excited to make the crossing without a view we are slow to get moving.   Luckily we were delayed because we were teased with a burlesque show if thining clouds revealing views of the lush Valley we had left behind and mountain tops in our heading direction.  By the time we were really heading down the trail the passing had stripped off most of its clouds and sun dazzled in the blue skies.   The trail down was steep rocky but was manageable on rested legs.     The thin trail hugged a cliff face giving remarkable views of expansion of green grass giving away to trees far bellow all protected on all sides by guarding mountains.   <br>We pass my marker 17 and are in good spirits we are making good time and have crossed 7.5 miles of our 9.5 day and we are in good spirits.   Passing over an avalanche field of rocks stream we tuck ourselves back into the tree line saying good bye to the baking sun but also of stunning views.   Micheal one of our  guides informs us that we are 2 hours from the lodge we thought we miss heard him because an hour a mile doesn't sound right.  In the shadow of the trees the trail turns difficult deep steps down balancing on rock edges make the trail challenge.   Our watches run out off power and we have no idea how far we have gone as we drop 100s of meters as we cross this last section before the end of our day.   The trail turns so steep that a metal staircase was in stalled over looking a cascade of water and waterfalls off of the left.   Loosing heart that we haven't seen a trail marker we wonder if we have just gotten to a crawl.   I try my best to keep spirits up as Vivian fights for every step.  Finally we pass marker 19 that both gives us hope and crushes our mood because we have a mile or more before we are done for the day.   I have slowed down pointing out the jutting rock ends that are smaller step downs for Vivian and besides the small bursts of encouragements that we are doing great and that she is amazing we hike in mostly silence.  I cheer her on as we pass the 20th mile marker and we know the turn off to the lodge is some where before the 21st marker.   Shuffling the last deep trail we discuss that we most likely won't add on the trail to the waterfall even though we have miraculously gotten in before the time cut off to add in the extra 1.5 hour hike.   <br>Like zombies we head into the lodge snacks and drink are waiting for us as we wait for our tour of the lodge and our room designation.  Our room is on the second floor and the twelve steps seem like an ask too much but we make it.   In the room I collapse on the floor and tear off my boots just to free of them.   Laying on the floor I let all my joints decompress as I groan the challenge of the day.   Some combination of FOMO and finding another wind I decide I'm going to the waterfall and adding more distance into my day and I am shocked when Vivian agrees to do it also.   The trail to the Sutherland Falls says it is 45 minutes to the tallest waterfall in New Zealand and we head out.   Thankfully the first third of the hike is mostly flat and smooth.   We question our sanity when the trail starts a dramatic change of up and deep stairs.   We curse ourselves as we add extra onto an already exhausting day.   I am now determined to see the falls and my will power seems to drag my wife along too.  The last third is a nice repreave of flat-ish hiking.  A sign gives us false hope that states we are now as far from the base of the falls as it is tall.   580m of rock terrain await our passage till we reach the falls.   We are the last of the hikers to make the falls and as we get wet from the showering spray from the falls last drop of 280m we are pretty pleased we made it.   Declan our sweaper guide moves us on saying we need to head back.   Some how we find a solidly good pace back to the lodge and return under 50 minutes.  Now closer to 12 miles for the day we permanently say good bye to out books for the day.  <br>Evening rituals of shower, change into lodge cloths, washing hiking cloths and using the dryroom finally gets us back into the common lodge where we are treated to good company, stories of the day from others and a good meal of salad ribeye steaks and desert.  Clouds move in so even if we could have lasted till darkness there wouldn't have been stars.  Well earned sleep finds us quickly and we don't even notice the generators cutting out at 10pm.  <br><a data-href="Edited — Day 3 - Milford Track - Alpine Crossing" href="personal/travel/milford-track/edited-—-day-3-milford-track-alpine-crossing.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Edited — Day 3 - Milford Track - Alpine Crossing</a>]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/day-3-alpine-crossing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Day 3 - Alpine Crossing.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Day 4 - walkout]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Milford Track- Day 4: The Walkout<br>Morning routines and well earned stiffness slow us down.  Those twelve steps were a challenge on the knees and we contemplate the flat 13 mile hike out to the boat that would take us to our last lodge.   Painkillers, stretching, coffee get us back into the group with poles in hands and packs on our backs.   <br>At this point we have all learned that the sand flies are not to be trifaled with because their un-assuming bites have turned red and extremely itchy.  Both Vivian an I woke up trying not to itch.   And this area doesn't just have more of these little vampires but the air is cloudy with them.    Slathered with bug dope they still find areas not perfectly covered.   <br>We are driven by them because any pause in movement causes a Pigpen like swarm to form around you in seconds.   <br>This day starts off 2 mile down hill that then breaks into a rolling flat terrain.  Thankfully this downhill isn't nearly as challenging as the trail leading up to the lodge.    The first break is at 5.5 miles at a boat house and  then a second lunch spot 4.5 miles at Giants gate falls and then trail wraps up in the a 3 mile segment were we will transferred over 17 people at a time every half an hour to our final lodge in Milford Sound.  <br>Markers pass  by and our pace is solid driven by the flies and the unchallenging trail.   Most of it is crushed rock few roots and steps but allows us to keep up the speed. <br>Dechland keeps pace with us for a while and we talk board games.   He is a nice Australian who is quite interesting.   He has been our most social guide we had on the trip.   <br>At the boat house we dash inside after dropping packs because the flies are extra vicious.  <br>We passed Mackay Falls which is a gorgeous emerald-pooled waterfall.   It is said to be the prettiest falls in New Zealand and I would hate to pick favorites but this would be one of the best we had seen over our adventures on these islands.<br>In and out of dense mossed trees I would not have believed it could get greener from our first day but everywhere was green leafy and the ground was a soft spong-like footing at times.   It was a pleasant walk heading in the valley of the pass.   <br>Markers started to blur without picture taken in between as we creeped higher toward thirty.    Then we bursted out on to one of the longest suspension bridges and caught view of many of our fellow hikes in the mist wash of Nuku-tau-roa/Giants Gate  Falls.    <br>The strong breeze and mist of the falls kept most of the sandflies at bay.  I ate the sweets from lunch collection a gluten free coconut chocolate bar and the inner pieces of my left over sandwich.    Having done the math knowing we would be forced to wait on rounds of boat crossings while being quickly devoured by the bugs I wanted to make sure I was on the 2nd boat.    We had meet up with Troy and Mary and I set what felt like I ke a blistering pace.   If my math was right in the next 3 miles we would have to overtake 6 other hikers to make it on the 3 pm boat versus the 3:30.   Happily stopping for 4 0person selfies with the mileposts we got to the ferry house and put our names in for slots 28-32.    After we had a seat secured so we then  strolled to the last sign saying we had made it to the end of the trail at 34.4 miles at s and fly point.  <br>Because independent hikes get priority for the boat the four of us were the last people called to get on the boat a few moments later.  <br>A jumpy splashing ride later were in Milford warf and busses catried us the last 1km to our lodge.    <br>It was a great hike and we all felt sore but accomplished.   From our lodge we had crystal clear views of the mountains surrounding the Sound.  <br>That night we had a chance to invite out guides to eat with us and we chatted about many topics but the topic that made Maya  daughter of Troy and Maria squimish was  all of us taking turns saying the strangest thing we have ever eaten. <br><a data-href="Edited—Day 4 - The walkout" href="personal/travel/milford-track/edited—day-4-the-walkout.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Edited—Day 4 - The walkout</a>]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/day-4-walkout.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Day 4 - walkout.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Day 5 - Thousands of Waterfalls]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Milford Track - Day 5: A sound of a thousand waterfalls<br>We had shipped forward to the last lodge a change of clothes and shoes. So in the morning we were thankful not to have to wear trail-washed hiking clothes and our feet thanked us to not be put back into boots.  <br>After our last routine of breakfast and packing lunch, we took a bus to our cruise of Milford Sound.  Heading to the bus we could barely see the mountains of the sound and a steady misting rain had rolled in obscuring the what last night was a mile of view into the open waters of the sound.     Many of us were disappointed for the loss of visablity and a rainy last day, but all were thankful for having the excellent weather  during the hiking days.   <br>We all settled into the boat thinking this would be a wasted hour on a boat were nothing interesting would be seen.   As soon as we had passed the first half a kilometer into the water the cliff sides turned into steep stone and with that there was no where for the rain to go without becoming waterfalls.   Any rock face closest enough to peirce the curtains of mist and clouds was adorned with lacy draped waterfalls.   Milford Sound has 3 permanent waterfalls but on rainy days there were close to a hundred streaming, cascading, and falling waters all across the  the Sound.    <br>Many of us geared for rain stood in the elements in awe of the spectical that Milford Sound transforms into during the rain.   <br>The obscured view in any distance make the stone faces seem impossibly tall. The tops of the stone walls kiss the clouds and some of the falls seem to originate in the heavens.    300 meters is the height of the giant centientals of the sound and supposedly the depth is mirrored in the water.   <br>Because the depth of water the boat at the permanent waterfalls can push its nose into the waterfall itself.  when the bow dipped into the sheet of waterfalls and new rumble was added to the boat and reverberateing the the steel bones.   The water intensified in the air by magnitudes.   A few seconds even that the back of the boat was enough to allow water to poor off you from every angle.   <br>The captain of the vessel commented that getting wet from falls could keep you young staying the skipper is close to ninety and the last capitan was 120 before he handed over the boat to him.   <br>Most of us looked like drown cats as we pulled back into the docks but all of us were happy to see the magic that Milford could provide.  Back we started our4 hour ride home.    Through raindrop bedazzled windows the valley leaving the sound the temperate rainrest seemed to rejoice and revel in the rain.  Like the sound the mountain edges of the valley wore their jeweled waterfall.  Afew steep switchbacks on the bus and we are at the tunnel leaving the Milford area.   Close to a kilometer of a dark and lightly flooded tunnel takes us through the highest point of the road.   <br>Exiting the other side the sky splits open and the sky shows patches of sky.   <br>We all are satisfied and we doze while heading back to Queenstown.  We had  done of the prettiest walk in to world and we we were happy we did it.  <br><a data-href="Edited — Day 5 - A sound of a thousand waterfalls" href="personal/travel/milford-track/edited-—-day-5-a-sound-of-a-thousand-waterfalls.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Edited — Day 5 - A sound of a thousand waterfalls</a>]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/day-5-thousands-of-waterfalls.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Day 5 - Thousands of Waterfalls.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Edited — Day 3 - Milford Track - Alpine Crossing]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Day 3 - Milford Track: Alpine Crossing<br>The days have now settled into a routine. We wake up and stretch to shake off the stiffness. We prepare our lunch at the central lodge and have breakfast. Then, we return to our rooms, pack everything into our backpacks, and put on our hiking boots. With around 20 pounds on our backs, we hit the trail.<br>This morning, the sky is heavily clouded, but we don't anticipate any rain, so we all set out together. However, due to the steep terrain, the gaps between hikers quickly widen, and my wife and I soon find ourselves walking alone.<br>About an hour into the hike, still in the woods and gaining some elevation, we drop our packs at the next huts and toilets. Here, we catch glimpses of Kea, an alpine parrot. These birds are pretty talkative and loud.<br>Back on the trail, we begin the Alpine crossing. There are 11 original switchbacks, each about a third of a kilometer long. Additionally, due to a rock slide, there are four extra switchbacks labeled a, b, c, and d, which are steep and short. As we ascend 600 meters, the parrots continue to squawk and chatter in the fog-covered trees and moss, creating an almost Jurassic Park-like atmosphere.<br>Once we pass the halfway point of the switchbacks, we enter the Alpine region. Shadowy glimpses of the parrots still haunt us, obscured by the thickening clouds. We leave the trees behind, giving way to large leafy plants, wildflowers, and spiky grass. Looking up, we can see colorful blurs within the mist of fellow hikers as the switchbacks crisscross above and below each other.<br>Finally, the trail loops back on itself, and we find ourselves on the ridge. Strong winds and clouds greet us as we continue to climb and descend on the grass-covered Mckinnon Pass. A monument commemorates the adventurers who mapped this route over the pass.

At this point, I begin to question whether lugging my 4 lb camera on this trail will be worthwhile.<br>We soon pass a sign indicating that it's a 30-minute walk to the shelter where we plan to take a lunch break.

We are making good time and have completed 7.5 miles of our 9.5-mile journey for the day. As we cross an avalanche field of rocks and a stream, we re-enter the tree line, saying goodbye to the baking sun and the stunning views. Michael, one of our guides, informs us that we are 2 hours from the lodge. We initially think we misheard him because an hour per mile doesn't sound right. In the shadow of the trees, the trail becomes challenging with deep steps down and balancing on rock edges. Our watches run out of power, and we have no idea how far we've gone as we descend hundreds of meters in this final section before the end of our day. The trail becomes so steep that a metal staircase has been installed, overlooking a cascade of water and waterfalls to the left. We lose heart as we haven't seen a trail marker, wondering if we're making progress. I do my best to keep spirits up as Vivian struggles with each step. Finally, we pass marker 19, which gives us hope but also dampens our mood because we still have a mile or more to go before we're done for the day. I slow down, pointing out the smaller step-downs for Vivian. Aside from sporadic words of encouragement and acknowledgment of her strength, we hike mostly in silence. I cheer her on as we pass the 20th-mile marker, knowing the turnoff to the lodge is somewhere before the 21st marker. Descending the final stretch of the trail, we discuss that we probably won't add the trail to the waterfall, even though we miraculously made it in time to add the extra 1.5-hour hike.<br>Like zombies, we reach the lodge, where snacks and drinks await us as we wait for our lodge tour and room assignment. Our room is on the second floor, and the twelve steps feel daunting, but we manage. Inside the room, I collapse on the floor and quickly remove my boots to free my tired feet. Lying on the floor, I let all my joints decompress, groaning from the day's challenges. Some combination of FOMO and newfound energy drives me to decide to visit the waterfall, and I'm surprised when Vivian agrees. The trail to Sutherland Falls indicates a 45-minute hike to New Zealand's tallest waterfall, and we set out. Fortunately, the first third of the hike is mostly flat and smooth. Our sanity is questioned as the trail transitions into a series of steep stairs. We curse ourselves for adding more to an already exhausting day. Determination fuels us as we are determined to see the falls, and my willpower drags my wife along, too. The final third offers a reprieve of relatively flat hiking. A sign gives us false hope, stating that we are now as far from the base of the falls as it is tall – 580 meters of rocky terrain await our passage to reach the falls. We are the last hikers to make it to the falls, and as we get wet from the spray of the final 280-meter drop, we feel satisfied that we made it. Declan, our sweeper guide, urges us to head back. Somehow, we find a solid pace on the return journey and return to the lodge in under 50 minutes. With our day's distance now closer to 12 miles, we bid farewell to our boots for the day.<br>In the evening, we follow our customary routine of showering, changing into lodge clothing, washing our hiking clothes, and using the dryroom. Eventually, we return to the common lodge, where we enjoy good company, listen to stories from others about their day, and savor a meal of salad, ribeye steaks, and dessert. Clouds move in, so there are no stars to be seen even if we had stayed up until darkness. We fall asleep quickly, not even noticing when the generators cut out at 10 pm.]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/edited-—-day-3-milford-track-alpine-crossing.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Edited — Day 3 - Milford Track - Alpine Crossing.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Edited — Day 5 - A sound of a thousand waterfalls]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Milford Track - Day 5: A Sound of a Thousand Waterfalls<br>We had shipped a change of clothes and shoes ahead to the last lodge, so in the morning, we were thankful not to have to wear trail-washed hiking clothes. Our feet thanked us for not having to be crammed back into boots.<br>After our usual routine of breakfast and packing lunch, we took a bus to our cruise of Milford Sound. Heading to the bus, we could barely see the mountains of the sound, and a steady misting rain had rolled in, obscuring what last night was a mile of view into the open waters of the sound. Many of us were disappointed about the loss of visibility and a rainy last day, but all were thankful for having excellent weather during the hiking days.<br>We all settled into the boat, thinking this would be a wasted hour on a boat where nothing interesting would be seen. As soon as we had passed the first half a kilometer into the water, the cliff sides turned into steep stone, and with that, there was nowhere for the rain to go without becoming waterfalls. Any rock face close enough to pierce the curtains of mist and clouds was adorned with lacy draped waterfalls. Milford Sound has three permanent waterfalls, but on rainy days, there were close to a hundred streaming, cascading, and falling waters all across the Sound.<br>Many of us geared for rain stood in the elements in awe of the spectacle that Milford Sound transforms into during the rain.<br>The obscured view in any distance makes the stone faces seem impossibly tall. The tops of the stone walls kiss the clouds, and some of the falls seem to originate in the heavens. Three hundred meters is the height of the giant sentinels of the sound, and supposedly, the depth is mirrored in the water.<br>Because of the depth of the water, the boat at the permanent waterfalls can push its nose into the waterfall itself. When the bow dipped into the sheet of waterfalls, a new rumble was added to the boat, reverberating the steel bones. The water intensified in the air by magnitudes. A few seconds, even at the back of the boat, was enough to allow water to pour off you from every angle.<br>The captain of the vessel commented that getting wet from falls could keep you young; staying the skipper is close to ninety, and the last captain was 120 before he handed over the boat to him.<br>Most of us looked like drowned cats as we pulled back into the docks, but all of us were happy to see the magic that Milford could provide. Back, we started our 4-hour ride home. Through raindrop-bedazzled windows, the valley leaving the sound, the temperate rainforest seemed to rejoice and revel in the rain. Like the sound, the mountain edges of the valley wore their jeweled waterfall. A few steep switchbacks on the bus, and we are at the tunnel leaving the Milford area. Close to a kilometer of a dark and lightly flooded tunnel takes us through the highest point of the road.<br>Exiting the other side, the sky splits open, and the sky shows patches of blue sky.<br>We all are satisfied, and we doze while heading back to Queenstown. We had done one of the prettiest walks in the world, and we were happy we did it.]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/edited-—-day-5-a-sound-of-a-thousand-waterfalls.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Edited — Day 5 - A sound of a thousand waterfalls.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Edited—Day 4 - The walkout]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>Milford Track- Day 4: The Walkout<br>Morning routines and well-earned stiffness slow us down.  Those twelve steps were a challenge on the knees, and we contemplated how difficult the flat 13-mile hike out to the boat would be to take us to our last lodge.   Painkillers, stretching, and coffee get us back into the group with poles in our hands and packs on our backs.   <br>At this point, we have all learned that the sand flies are not to be trifled with because their unassuming bites have turned red and extremely itchy. Both Vivian and I woke up trying not to itch at 2 AM, and this area doesn't just have more of these little vampires, but the air is cloudy with them.    Slathered with bug dope they still find areas not perfectly covered.   <br>We are driven by them because any pause in movement causes a Pigpen-like swarm to form around you in seconds.   <br>This day starts off 2 miles downhill and then breaks into a rolling, flat terrain.  Thankfully, this downhill isn't nearly as challenging as the trail leading up to the lodge.    The first break is at 5.5 miles at a boat house and then a second lunch spot at 4.5 miles at Giants Gate Falls, and then the trail wraps up in the 3-mile segment where we will transfer over 17 people at a time every half an hour to our final lodge in Milford Sound.  <br>Most of the trail has minimal inclines up or down, and it consists of crushed rock with few roots and infrequent steps, but it allows us to keep up the speed. Markers pass quickly, and our pace is brisk, driven by the flies and the unchallenging trail.   <br>Dechland, our guide, keeps pace with us for a while, and we talk about our background and then board games.   He is a friendly Australian who is quite interesting.   He is the most social guide we had on the trip.   5.5 miles blur by, and we approach lunch stop number 1. I guess while in New Zealand eat like a hobbit.  <br>At the boat house, we dash inside after dropping packs because the flies are extra vicious.  <br>We passed Mackay Falls which is a gorgeous emerald-pooled waterfall.   It is said to be the prettiest falls in New Zealand and I would hate to pick favorites but this would be one of the best we had seen over our adventures on these islands.<br>In and out of dense mossed trees, I would not have believed it could get greener from our first day, but everywhere was green leafy, and the ground was a soft sponge-like footing at times.   It was a pleasant walk heading in the valley of the pass.   <br>Markers started to blur without a picture taken in between as we crept higher toward thirty.    Then we burst onto one of the longest suspension bridges and saw many of our fellow hikes in the mist wash of Nuku-tau-roa/Giants Gate  Falls.    <br>The strong breeze and mist of the falls kept most sandflies at bay.  I ate the sweets from the lunch collection, a gluten-free coconut chocolate bar, and the inner pieces of my leftover sandwich.    Having done the math knowing we would be forced to wait on rounds of boat crossings while being quickly devoured by the bugs I wanted to make sure I was on the 2nd boat.    We had met up with Troy and Mary, and I set what felt like a blistering pace.   If my math were correct, in the next 3 miles, we would have to overtake six other hikers to make it on the 3 pm boat versus the 3:30.   Happily stopping for 4 0person selfies with the mileposts, we got to the ferry house and put our names, in for slots 28-32.    After we had a seat secured we then strolled to the last sign saying we had made it to the end of the trail at 34.4 miles at s and fly point.  <br>Because independent hikes get priority for the boat the four of us were the last people called to get on the ship a few moments later.  <br>A jumpy splashing ride later was in Milford warf and busses catried us the last 1km to our lodge.    <br>It was a great hike, and we all felt sore but accomplished.   From our lodge we had crystal clear views of the mountains surrounding the Sound.  <br>That night we had a chance to invite out guides to eat with us, and we chatted about many topics, but the topic that made Maya, daughter of Troy and Maria, squeamish was all of us taking turns saying the strangest thing we had ever eaten. I went last knowing I could probably trump the others with either black Scorpion or fire ants on a Salad in Cambodia.  <br>All of tried to last in the bar after dinner and chatted with our now new friends but sleep found all of quickly and even though we didn't have a generator that would kill the power we all dropped off one-by-one before 11pm.]]></description><link>personal/travel/milford-track/edited—day-4-the-walkout.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Milford Track/Edited—Day 4 - The walkout.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Milford Sound]]></title><description><![CDATA[

<br>Here's the updated text:<br>Brisbane is a stark contrast to Melbourne. My first reaction is that the city is very modern and also very homogeneous. Looking at the ethnicity demographics, the city is over 70% Australian, English, and Irish. The mood and vibe of the city reflect this. The ethnic food and diversity are replaced with wine bars, white-linen restaurants, and pubs.<br>This city seems to have a strong economy. From our hotel window, I can see construction for a new subway station, a pedestrian bridge to cross the river, and two skyscrapers.<br>Walking around the streets, the CBD has very few sentimental connections to its past. Unless a building was linked to a historical event or government purpose, the space has been razed and replaced with new glass and steel. Everywhere there are mirror-finished walls, and nothing seems older than a few decades.<br>The heart of the city is intertwined with the bends of the river. The edges feature an extensive river path that is either embedded within elaborate parklands or placed on boardwalks studded with restaurants and cafes.<br>Stepping away from the water, there is a collection of skyscrapers that loom like cliffs on both sides of the river.<br>The CBD quickly fades as you move away from the river bends, replaced by residential housing, both modern and what feels like late 20th century. Either the weather erodes the history or money destroys it, to be replaced by new.<br>By car, even the residential area gives way quickly to trees and forests. Houses play hide and seek among their own groves of trees. The population extends out from the city, but the density is low enough that it can sometimes feel like you have left the city zone until you encounter another cluster of houses and buildings at road intersections. This area finally doesn't seem as refreshed, but I can see even here that modernization and gentrification are eating away at any history.<br>This is a metropolitan city of the world. "Work hard and drink hard" is the heartbeat here, with every table occupied by young professionals, holding pints of beer or cocktails, seen all along the riverbanks.<br>During our short time here, we clearly didn't find the zones of the city that have preserved any personality other than "we are here for business" or "raising a new family."<br>In the end, I'm glad I have seen Brisbane, and it would be a lovely city to work from, but I don't expect to revisit for tourist reasons.]]></description><link>personal/travel/brisbane.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Brisbane.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Melbourne]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br>I was unsure what I was expecting to find when I traveled to Melbourne, but what I did discover was much more than I ever could’ve imagined. Melbourne is the second Sister city to Sydney like Montreal is to Quebec, Philadelphia to New York City or San Francisco to LA. Each city understand they will never outshine their bigger sister by being newer or shinier, but instead grabs peoples attention by sassy, charming, and sometimes weird.   <br>Melbourne has a rich history literally because in the 1800s it had so much gold that it was the riches city in the world.   It pulled 1/3 of the mined gold of the world at the time.  Since then it has been the capital of Australia and lost it, gone through multiple boons and recessions and is now a multi-layerd city of grungy Street Art clad walls, Victorian splendor and slick steel and glass that stretches into the sky.   <br>We barely got outside of CBD (Central business district )  and the major grid of the area is lined with high end shops and theaters. Each block has 4 to 5 shoot-off breaks in the buildings and all of them display some form of collective history left behind in spray paint.    If you are scared off by the tight alleys and laneways covered in graffiti you would miss the true personality of the city because Melbourne wears these spray painted tapastries like a fine coat and in almost every space you can duck a way from the main drag you'll discover hidden in folds countless gems of cafes, bars, speakeasies, arcades(open air mall) restaurants and specialty shops.  Most people say to just get lost in Melbourne and you'll find your next favorite thing.   <br>This is a town full  imagrant fusion and charm.   20 years after this small town was established by Mr. Batman gold was found and the population rocketed from 10k  to almost a million people in under 5 years.  The trend of imagration has never gone away even after the gold was no longer being found.   Italian, Greek, and multiple Asian countries have struck a claim to this city so don't look for Australian/British here instead dive into the rich and authentic tastes of Thailand, Italy, Vietnam, India or China.   <br>After 4 days I didn't spend enough time in the this city.  And I clearly don't have the stomach or liver to say I have tasted it all.   It is no wonder to me now why Melbourne is one of the most livable cities of the world.   <br>Highlights:<br>
Heart Baker - Bahn Mi served in a literal hole in wall deep in a alley.<br>
Fitzroy - Boheman shopping bars and cafes<br>
Chin Chin - Thailand/ Vietnamese go-go bar<br>
Juicy Dumpling - authentic Shanghainess pan fried dumplings.<br>
Coffee shops galore but be warned if you want a coffee after 4pm you will need to get your caffeine in an espresso martini.<br>
Metro Burger- Exotic meat hamburgers.<br>
Ice Cream Shop - open to 11 pm.<br>
Bubble Tea - Everywhere.<br>
Yara Valley -   Exceptional wine tours with more then 30 pours of tastings before the end of the day.   <br><a data-href="Melbourne Edited" href="personal/travel/melbourne-edited.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Melbourne Edited</a>]]></description><link>personal/travel/melbourne.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Travel/Melbourne.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Melbourne Edited]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Just two decades after its establishment, Melbourne experienced a population explosion, going from 10,000 to nearly a million people in under five years, all thanks to the discovery of gold in the 1850s.

While I am strong in adaptability, communication, and collaboration when projects are in the solution stage, I need to improve in the earlier stages of projects and conversations.<br>I find that having a clear endpoint is incredibly helpful for me, but this can sometimes make other team members feel rushed, unheard, or that I am dismissing their points. I need to become more aware of team members who may have this conflict with my style of thinking and work on suppressing my tendencies. This will allow others to come up to speed or reach a point where they are receptive to solutions.<br><br><br>As I continue to take on a wide spectrum of projects, ranging from amorphous to well-defined or even urgent fire drills, I need to focus on developing new working relationships with MarCom, Content Strategy, and UX. The goal is to establish a procedure, workflow, or at least a clearer demarcation of efforts among team members to reduce rework and overwork. While we all aim for the best outcomes for our projects, finding ways to reduce inefficiency is crucial.]]></description><link>personal/work-private/2024-06-mid-year.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Personal/Work Private/2024-06 Mid Year.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 05 Sep 2024 15:00:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Page 3 - Promotion]]></title><description/></item></channel></rss>

 <br>← back to <a data-href="Arches Conversion" href="work/acc/arches/conversion/arches-conversion.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Arches Conversion</a><br><br>Bulk Conversion Planning&nbsp;<br><br>
<br>
Identify a batch of pages as the upcoming candidate batch for conversion. Considerations:&nbsp;

<br>Can we target a good number of pages with the same component composition (they use the same components exclusively)? This lets us control variables.&nbsp;
<br>Provide a list of the components to UI for conversion.&nbsp;
<br>Confirm the batch with any interested parties if relevant (editorial, BL, users, etc etc)&nbsp;


<br>
UI analyzes component list conversion and provides LOE.&nbsp;

<br>How complex will the conversions be/How long will it take? Generally, this will hopefully be doable in one sprint assuming there is not any major rebuilding needed. Most importantly we need to determine how many will need to be rebuilt completely.&nbsp;

<br>Create tickets for each component up for conversion (we may be able to lump some lighter ones together, we can decide that after analysis).&nbsp;


<br>
Groom, add to schedule, etc.&nbsp;

<br><br>
<br>
UI team completes component conversion tickets.&nbsp;

<br>
QA tests converted components on sample pages in test environments.&nbsp; 

<br>
Push conversions to production,&nbsp;including deployments steps to make sure the components are available for use on all environments.&nbsp;

<br>
UI provides list of bulk changes, including&nbsp;

<br>Components that need to be switched to an Arches version in presentation layout.&nbsp;
<br>If applicable, a list of changes to rich text content where the change can realistically be done with a bulk script (i.e., search and replace)&nbsp;
<br>A list of issues from conversion that will need manual intervention.&nbsp;
<br><a data-href="New Component" href="work/acc/arches/conversion/new-component.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">New Component</a>


<br><br>
<br>Audit All Content Areas, and Custom Scripts for uses of In Page and Inline Script and Style Tags<br>
1. Output to and excel.  <a data-href="Audit of Editorial UI" href="work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/audit-of-editorial-ui.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Audit of Editorial UI</a><br>
2.  Internal Review of Audit<br>
1. List All Inbound Links and Evaluate Remediation of Links:<br>
1. Font Awesome  4.x - Delete, find all class names that start with fa- and end in -o and remove -o<br>
2. Font Awesome 5 or 6 - Delete<br>
3. Bootstrap JS &amp; CSS - Delete<br>

2. Review and In Page Script and Styles<br>
1. Dedupe and Style and Script Tag Blocks and save them outside of Sitecore<br>
1. Add Items to the <a data-href="Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel" href="work/acc/arches/conversion/process/excel/editorial-bulk-change-notice-excel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Editorial Bulk Change Notice Excel</a><br>
3. Run Clean Up scripts across  Richtext and CustomScript Sitecore components
<br><br>
<br>
Development creates scripts to process changes provided by UI in Sprint B.&nbsp;

<br>Precondition: Components that need to be switched to Arches has already been developed, tested,&nbsp; and pushed to ALL environments (DEV, SPR, STG, RLS, PRD)&nbsp;


<br>
Run script in development environment for specific pages that apply to this batch (i.e., #1) and verify.&nbsp;

<br>
Review affected pages for discrepancies/bugs for resolution (e.g., code, components, etc.)&nbsp;

<br>If code changes are required, create JIRA tickets for upcoming sprint.&nbsp; Sprint C will be paused until these code changes are made in ALL environment&nbsp;


<br>
Review and identify any content issues (rich text, custom scripts) and work w/ BL on resolution&nbsp;



<br>
Run clean up script to identify problematic scripts that need to be&nbsp;remediated&nbsp;(<a rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://support.acc.org/browse/AWC-3942" target="_blank">https://support.acc.org/browse/AWC-3942</a>) and push to environments accordingly.&nbsp;

<br>
Promote to other lower environments (SPR, STG, RLS) and validate in each environment accordingly.&nbsp;

<br>Perform demo for BL to review results of bulk conversion for batch in scope (STG or RLS) and obtain sign-off&nbsp;


<br>
Create a PRD back-up to support a rollback, if needed (requires further discussion around specific rollback tasks/steps)&nbsp;

<br>Take back-ups of both&nbsp;Author and Web DBs&nbsp;
<br>Need to enforce a&nbsp;content freeze&nbsp;(BL), specifically for a&nbsp;subset of pages/content&nbsp;


<br>
Promote to PRD and run bulk conversion script in Author ONLY, do NOT publish to Delivery.&nbsp;

<br>
IMPORTANT NOTE: To ensure content is NOT auto-published, there is a need to explore options.&nbsp;

<br>Option 1: Set content items to a DRAFT status when converting content in Author.&nbsp; See Sitecore DRAFT workflow doc&nbsp;<a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="https://accorg.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/tbs/Private/Agile%20Movement/AWC%20Team/Arches%20Conversion/Workflow-in-Sitecore.docx?d=w5e7e42edf5844f03b7be461f5ddc8b43&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=zZKy2Y" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp; Possible risk is the Original Posted Date may be updated as a result (need confirmation)&nbsp;
<br>Option 2: -- TBD&nbsp;


<br>
IT to perform spot checks in Author to ensure the conversion script was completed successfully.&nbsp;

<br>
BL reviews converted pages in Author and as pages are validated, publish in increments (as appropriate)&nbsp;

<br>UI, DEV, &amp; QA teams on standby to field any questions or address any concerns&nbsp;




<br>
Post Conversion/Clean Up Tasks&nbsp;(once all batches are complete, one-time task)&nbsp;

<br>Once conversion is complete, we will take the Arches presentations and merge them into the current legacy template presentation configurations, and delete the Arches versions, as clean up.&nbsp;


<br>QA Approach (DRAFT)&nbsp;<br>NOTE: This approach should be visited as we progress w/ the batches.&nbsp; Also, scheduled sprint content syncs should not adversely affect the Arches QA pages since they will already exist prior to the content sync.&nbsp;<br>
<br>UI/UX team will create an Arches QA dedicated page (e.g., page name to include '_ArchesQA' suffix&nbsp; in the DEV environment in support of their development &amp; verification process.&nbsp;
<br>Once the component updates have been verified in the DEV environment, UI/UX to request a Razl content sync to SPR in coordination w/ their updates getting built and deployed to SPR. (Ricky can assist w/ Razl syncs)&nbsp;
<br>QA will then use the Arches QA dedicated page in SPR to test the target components.&nbsp; Once validated in SPR, QA will work with DEV (Ricky) to sync content to upper environments (STG/RLS) as the changes are promoted.&nbsp;
<br>PRD deployment (e.g., pre-task) should include a step to sync the Arches QA dedicated page to PRD (Author ONLY, do not publish to Delivery) in order for QA validate in PRD.&nbsp;
<br>Once validated, need to ensure there is a clean-up process to remove/delete QA dedicated pages, once ready (in ALL environments)&nbsp;
<br>Notes:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>It is important that we have a way to roll back our work at any point throughout these cycles and we need to be able to do this in a way that BL can be comfortable with. This plan doesn’t really account for if something goes pear shaped in Sprint C but we should probably iron that out as well, especially if something goes wrong during the push to production.&nbsp;<br>This looks like a three-sprint process, but we may be able to consider identifying the next batch during sprint C to speed up conversion if necessary.<br><a href=".?query=tag:acc/arches" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/arches</a> <a href=".?query=tag:acc/arches/conversion" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/arches/conversion</a> <a href=".?query=tag:acc/guidance" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#acc/guidance</a> <br>Metadata

 <br>&nbsp;I want to outline a comprehensive Knowledge Transfer (KT) strategy that targets the required remediation steps. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition, allowing our team to manage the work systematically and avoid overwhelming our team resources and capabilities.&nbsp;<br>Here's a step-by-step process to guide our KT activities:<br>Sub-dividing the Conversion into Manageable Segments:&nbsp;We can accomplish tasks efficiently throughout the week by dividing the bulk conversion into themed work or manageable segments. For instance, focusing on a specific aspect like "all the pages that have tabs" will make the process more digestible and actionable.<br>Weekly Kick-off Meeting for Conversion Blocks:&nbsp;At the start of the week, we will convene a meeting where a conversion block of pages is presented. This meeting will include a live demo showing how to make the necessary changes, providing an excellent opportunity for team members to understand the process firsthand.<br>Standing 30-Minute Meetings throughout the Week:&nbsp;To ensure continuous support and clear communication, I suggest scheduling a standing 30-minute meeting every day. This stand-up meeting will be a forum to discuss any roadblocks or questions related to the assigned work. It will enable real-time problem-solving and maintain momentum in the project.<br>Here’s a high-level schedule to illustrate the flow:<br>Monday:&nbsp;Kick-off meeting with a conversion demo for the week's segment (e.g., pages with tabs).<br>Tuesday to Friday:&nbsp;Daily 30-minute stand-up sessions to address questions and roadblocks.<br>End of Week:&nbsp;Recap and assessment of the week's accomplishments, planning for the next segment.<br>By adhering to this process, we aim to create a structured approach to knowledge transfer, facilitating the handling complex conversion tasks and empowering our team with the confidence and competence needed.  <br>Also, it's worth mentioning that our KT process is designed to be flexible and responsive to the team's evolving needs. As our collective experience and proficiency grow, we anticipate that the demand and duration of the daily stand-up meetings may not be needed or shortened. We'll continually assess the progress and adjust accordingly, ensuring our approach remains efficient and aligned with the team's capabilities. Continued feedback will be instrumental in this ongoing refinement, keeping us agile and focused on our shared goals.  <br><br>ACC User Experience Team&nbsp;<br>American College of Cardiology<br>2400 N Street NW<br>Washington DC, 20037<br><a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="render:///www.acc.org" rel="noopener" class="external-link" href="render://www.acc.org" target="_blank">www.acc.org</a>]]></description><link>work/acc/arches/conversion/editorial-training/kt-sessions.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Editorial training/KT SESSIONS.md</guid><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 12:36:47 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[experience editor]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br><br><br>Considering the difficulties that editors encounter in distinguishing between legacy, converted, and legacy supportive components, owing to the absence of folder structure and clear naming, we've introduced a streamlined approach. All component icons are now set to grey or red by default. However, converted and supportive components, along with the majority of new work, will be marked with either blue icons for compatible renderings or green for new arches components. This blue color is intended to be the default setting both arches and legacy supportive components. It's essential for the development team to review and ensure this default setting when releasing new work into the platform. In any instance where the blue green or grey is not the icon for the rending, the setting must be promptly corrected.<br>
Further Icon Definition allow for even easier recognition in the back end will be. Page Layout components should be Starts, Vue/JavaScript driven components should be puzzle pieces.  <br><br>When looking at the display view list in the backend you only see the render name and its relative location that it is placed in the list. As the teams move forward in using more and more shared content and breaking down content into chunks the Display view gets rather unuable becuase you would see RichText written possilbly 5 times on the page the same is true with accordions. In that view is it possible to interject at least the details of the source which can be altered with a nickname like intro-text, benifit grid.....<br><br>The component dependency tree outlines the interrelationships between components in a Sitecore instance, specifically identifying those that are either children of a component or have dependent child components. Only necessary components should be configured in this instance to maintain simplicity and reduce confusion for editors. This approach also minimizes the risk of including non-supportive components by lessening the need for editors to manually add components. Ultimately, this method aids in preventing the appearance of non-supportive components within converted pages, ensuring a clean and efficient working environment.]]></description><link>work/acc/arches/conversion/components/quality-of-life-configurations-with-sitecore.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Work/ACC/Arches/Conversion/Components/Quality of life configurations with Sitecore.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 12 Sep 2024 22:05:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Creating A New ACC.org Component]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>The Hero Image on the homepage will now support an optional overlay button. This button will be configurable by content editors, allowing them to set the URL, text, style (primary or secondary), and position on the image based on different breakpoints (phone, small tablet, large tablet, and desktop).<br>Scope of the Feature:<br>
<br>If there is no URL and Label included in the configuration of the component the hero image area will not be clickable and the render will not render any button UI.
<br>It is MarComs responsibility to deliver an images in the correct size and dimensions with non critical information in the area where the button will be positioned.

<br>Sizes: 300x350, 600x300,900x300,1200x400
<br>Accepted images are PNG, JPG


<br>You can only choose 1 button position, style, URL, and label for all break points.
<br>The entire area of the Positioning grid will be clickable and cause the button to hover.
<br>The cards part of the feature will also will have their click box expanded to their entire area.
<br>Acceptance Criteria:<br>
<br>Button Configuration Options:

<br>URL: Editors can input the target URL for the button. This URL if empty and the Label is included should default to About-ACC URL
<br>Label: Editors can input the display text for the button.
<br>Style:

<br>Primary Button: Teal blue with white text.
<br>Secondary Button: Light grey with black text.
<br>ACC Brand Button: ACC Blue with white text
<br>ACC Brand Reversed: White with ACC Blue Text


<br>Position:

<br>Options: 'Left', 'Center', and 'Right'.
<br>Position varies depending on the breakpoint (refer to the "Button Position Based on Breakpoint" section below).




<br>Button Position Based on Breakpoint:

<br>Button Positioning Grid:

<br>the Grid inset is 0 0 60px 0 to the full width and eight of the image.
<br>1 rem padding from the edge of its inset image.
<br>The hit area of the image should be the entire area.


<br>Phone:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 4 (height)
<br>Button should size down one step from normal.
<br>Uploaded Size: 300w x 350h
<br>Grid Layout: 1 column x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Regardless of 'Left', 'Center', or 'Right' setting, the button will be centered in the bottom row.




<br>Small Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 2 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 600w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 2 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Large Tablet:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 900w x 300h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 2 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell, centered vertically and horizontally.




<br>Desktop:

<br>Aspect Ratio: 3 (width) x 1 (height)
<br>Uploaded Size: 1200w x 400h
<br>Grid Layout: 3 columns x 3 rows
<br>Positioning:

<br>Left: Bottom-left cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.
<br>Center: Bottom center cell of the last row, centered horizontally and vertically.
<br>Right: Bottom-right cell of the last row, centered vertically and horizontally.






<br>Responsive Behavior:

<br>The button's position and size should adjust dynamically based on the device's screen size and aspect ratio.
<br>The button should not overlap important text or imagery unless specified in the design guidelines.<br>
( this will be the responsibility of theMarCom to not place critical information in the art in the areas they selected for the button placement. )


<br>Editor Preview:

<br>Provide a preview in the CMS where editors can see how the button will look on different breakpoints before publishing.


<br>QA Testing Notes:<br>
<br>Test button configuration for all breakpoints.
<br>Validate button positioning aligns with the specified grid layouts.
<br>Verify that styling changes correctly based on editor selection.
<br>Test keyboard navigation and screen reader accessibility.

 <br>KSS, or Knyle Style Sheets, is a documentation syntax for CSS that allows developers to create a living style guide from CSS comments. It's structured to be both human-readable and machine-parsable, enabling automated tools to generate style guides from your CSS files. Here's an example of a comprehensive KSS comment block for a CSS stylesheet, including all the main options it can have:<br>/*
A button suitable for giving a user a call to action.

Style guide: Components.Buttons.Primary

:hover             - Highlights when hovered.
:disabled          - Dims the button when it cannot be interacted with.
.small             - A smaller button for less important actions.
.large             - A larger button for more important actions.

Markup:
&lt;button class="btn {{modifier_class}}"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;

Modifiers:
- .small - A small version of the primary button
- .large - A large version of the primary button

State classes:
- .is-active - Highlights the button as active
- .is-disabled - Shows the button as disabled

Variables:
- $btn-background-color: Color of the button background.
- $btn-text-color: Color of the button text.

$btn-background-color: #007bff;
$btn-text-color: #ffffff;
